The objective of this study was to investigate the potential of visible and near-infrared (VIS-NIR) spectroscopy for identifying HLB-infected citrus trees. The spectral data from infected and healthy orange trees of the Valencia variety were collected from four different orchards in Florida. Two different spectroradiometers with a spectral range of 350 to 2500 nm were used to collect the canopy reflectance spectral data. Three classification techniques were used to classify the data: k-nearest neighbors (KNN), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machines (SVM). Analysis showed that using only one canopy reflectance observation per tree was inadequate. None of the classification methods was successful in discriminating healthy trees from HLB-infected trees because of the large variability in the canopy reflectance spectral data. When five spectra from the same tree were used for classification, the SVM and weighted KNN methods classified spectra with 3.0% and 6.5% error rates, respectively. The results from this study indicate that canopy VIS-NIR spectral reflectance data can be used to detect HLB-infected citrus trees; however, high classification accuracy (>90%) requires multiple measurements from a single tree.",32.0,2.909090909090909,False,"['M', '-', '-', '-']","[None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None]",12,-1,8.682210299865953e-05,-1,1,0.10488981,0.4519480764865875,0.5259488224983215,0.620890200138092,0.3866179585456848,0.2694115042686462,1.0,47.0,12.0,232.0,135,93.11659192825113,0.6748971193415638,0.2716049382716049,1.9588477366255144,21.526981481481528

In this work, we give algorithms achieving strong guarantee under two realistic noise models. In bounded deterministic noise, an adversary can add any bounded yet unstructured noise to each column. For this problem, we present an algorithm that returns a matrix of a small error, with sample complexity almost as small as the best prior results in the noiseless case. For sparse random noise, where the corrupted columns are sparse and drawn randomly, we give an algorithm that exactly recovers an $\mu_0$-incoherent matrix by probability at least $1-\delta$ with sample complexity as small as $O(\mu_0rn\log(r/\delta))$. This result advances the state-of-the-art work and matches the lower bound in a worst case.

The approach is based on developing various hierarchical multi-attribute models that consist of qualitative attributes and utility (aggregation) functions, represented by decision rules. The assessment of soil quality is based on two main indicators: (1) soil diversity (assessed through microfauna, mesofauna and macrofauna richness) and (2) soil functioning (in terms of leaching, comminution, mineralisation and plant growth). Here we address the methodological aspects of the model and its development, and describe the components of the model (attributes, value scales, decision rules and weights). We present initial results of its application to the assessment of crop management on soil quality in the case of using conventional and Bt-maize at three field sites in France and Denmark.

We acquired functional MR images during an auditory language task to evaluate systematic differences in language-network activation between control and high-functioning autistic populations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-one right-handed male subjects (26 high-functioning autistic subjects, 15 controls) were studied by using an auditory phrase-recognition task, and areas of differential activation between groups were identified. Hand preference, verbal intelligence quotient (IQ), age, and language-function testing were included as covariables in the analysis. RESULTS: Control and autistic subjects showed similar language-activation networks, with 2 notable differences. Control subjects showed significantly increased activation in the left posterior insula compared with autistic subjects (P < .05, false discovery rate), and autistic subjects showed increased bilaterality of receptive language compared with control subjects. Higher receptive-language scores on standardized testing were associated with greater activation of the posterior aspect of the left Wernicke area. A higher verbal IQ was associated with greater activation of the bilateral Broca area and involvement of the prefrontal cortex and lateral premotor cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Control subjects showed greater activation of the posterior insula during receptive language, which may correlate with impaired emotive processing of language in autism.

We tested this prediction by investigating whether bulky glycoproteins in the glycocalyx promote a tumour phenotype in human cells by increasing integrin adhesion and signalling. Our data revealed that a bulky glycocalyx facilitates integrin clustering by funnelling active integrins into adhesions and altering integrin state by applying tension to matrix-bound integrins, independent of actomyosin contractility. Expression of large tumour-associated glycoproteins in non-transformed mammary cells promoted focal adhesion assembly and facilitated integrin-dependent growth factor signalling to support cell growth and survival.

Stainless steel of grade AISI 316 has wide applications in medical science, automobile engineering, aviation, and aerospace industry due to their favourable material properties such as low thermal conductivity, high corrosion resistance, and high strength to weight ratio. Micro-machining of AISI 316 with high aspect ratio is a difficult task due to excessive heat generation, micro-structural changes, and tool breakage. Laser beam machining (LBM) process is a suitable alternative machining process, since it localizes the heat source to control the micro-structural changes. The difficulty arises during laser drilling because of spatter area and heat affected zone (HAZ), which adversely affects the quality of laser drilled holes. The present study attempts to experimentally investigate the effect of laser process parameters such as pulse width, laser energy, pulse frequency, and flushing pressure on the performance measures such as spatter deposition and heat affected zone (HAZ) during drilling operation. To reduce the total number of experimental run and obtain maximum information for the experimental trials, Taguchi L27 has been adopted. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is performed to identify significant laser parameters influencing both the performance measures. From the study, it is revealed that pulse width is the most significant parameter in the formation of spatter and HAZ. From the results, it is identified that spatter area initially increases with increase in pulse frequency and then decreases for any level of pulse width. As pulse frequency increases, laser power increases resulting in more heat input into the material. This causes increase in vapour pressure inside the laser drilled hole, more material ejection, and increase in spatter area. However, laser supported absorption (LSA) waves developed at higher value of pulse frequency brings about blockage of laser energy from the material surface as an engrossing plasma, which results in reduction of material ejection and reduction in spatter area. It is observed that HAZ increases with increase in pulse width and pulse frequency. It may be due to higher average power of the laser beam, which is directly proportional to pulse width and pulse frequency. Higher the value of pulse width, higher will be the laser thermal energy and higher HAZ.",4.0,0.8,False,"['-', '-', '-', '-', 'F', '-', '-']","['Researcher', None, None, None, None, None, None]","[60, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[14, None, None, None, None, None, None]",18,1,0.4882833952958347,-1,1,0.07223449,0.2805188596248627,0.4757342934608459,0.2955569922924042,0.3304465711116791,0.2915636301040649,1.0,58.0,16.0,390.0,180,91.16310160427808,0.6598984771573604,0.2868020304568528,1.9695431472081213,15.445649746192942

The behaviors of others, however, are full of uncertainties. Both rational and irrational behaviors exist, and the autonomous vehicles need to be aware of this in their prediction module. The prediction module is also expected to generate reasonable results in the presence of unseen and corner scenarios. Two types of prediction models are typically used to solve the prediction problem: learning-based model and planning-based model. Learning-based model utilizes real driving data to model the human behaviors. Depending on the structure of the data, learning-based models can predict both rational and irrational behaviors. But the balance between them cannot be customized, which creates challenges in generalizing the prediction results. Planning-based model, on the other hand, usually assumes human as a rational agent, i.e., it anticipates only rational behavior of human drivers. In this paper, a generic prediction architecture is proposed to address various rationalities in human behavior. We leverage the advantages from both learning-based and planning-based prediction models. The proposed approach is able to predict continuous trajectories that well-reflect possible future situations of other drivers. Moreover, the prediction performance remains stable under various unseen driving scenarios. A case study under a real-world roundabout scenario is provided to demonstrate the performance and capability of the proposed prediction architecture.",12.0,3.0,False,"['-', '-', 'M']","['Postdoctoral Researcher, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory', None, None]","[69, None, None]","[4, None, None]",10,-1,0.002570868039876,-1,-1,0.035485458,0.5569197535514832,0.5953513979911804,0.6569464206695557,0.4385526776313782,0.5011599063873291,1.0,35.0,14.0,228.0,123,90.4109589041096,0.6276150627615062,0.3389121338912134,2.100418410041841,12.595102510460292

Assuming ergodic fading, an Estimate-Compress-Forward (ECF) approach is investigated, whereby the BSs perform CSI estimation and forward a compressed version of the CSI to the CU. This approach contrasts with the previously studied Compress-Forward-Estimate (CFE) strategy, whereby CSI estimation is performed at the CU, and is motivated by the information-theoretic optimality of separate estimation and compression. Various ECF schemes are proposed that perform either separate or joint compression of estimated CSI and received baseband signal.

The two levels of the proposed technique are comprised of: designing the discrete firefly algorithm (DFFA) for the formation and implementation of makespan minimisation on parallel machines, followed by performing Ctrie-based caching for pairwise alignment to reduce the load on the data servers for handling multiple queries. The proposed strategy addresses a multi-client problem that aims to acquire the full advantage of the computational power of parallel connected machines. Further, it is shown that the inclusion of Ctrie as caching mechanism successively improves the performance of the system with accretion in several sequences. Performance of proposed DFFA is also compared with discrete versions of four swarm intelligence based algorithms at the criteria of makespan minimisation and the rate of convergence on two kinds of complex and diverse datasets. The work is unique in this sense: it is the first swarm-intelligence-based implementation for the addressed problem; it is so far the first approach for Ctrie based caching of the MSA on the scheduled parallel machines; hybridisation of DFFA with Ctrie for caching the MSA results is also a novel implementation.",17.0,4.25,False,"['F', 'M', 'M', 'M']","[None, 'Rajasthan Technical University, Kota', None, 'Professor of Electrical Engineering, MNIT Jaipur']","[None, 1415, None, 3553]","[None, 78, None, 326]",17,-1,6.205049602300741e-05,-1,-1,0.058113076,0.607244610786438,0.6742748022079468,0.442567378282547,0.7084431052207947,0.467251569032669,1.0,21.0,6.0,197.0,104,86.20879120879121,0.6039603960396039,0.3267326732673267,1.955445544554456,8.11230693069308

We conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis based in 135,458 cases and 344,901 controls and identified 44 independent and significant loci. The genetic findings were associated with clinical features of major depression and implicated brain regions exhibiting anatomical differences in cases. Targets of antidepressant medications and genes involved in gene splicing were enriched for smaller association signal. We found important relationships of genetic risk for major depression with educational attainment, body mass, and schizophrenia: lower educational attainment and higher body mass were putatively causal, whereas major depression and schizophrenia reflected a partly shared biological etiology. All humans carry lesser or greater numbers of genetic risk factors for major depression. These findings help refine the basis of major depression and imply that a continuous measure of risk underlies the clinical phenotype.A genome-wide association meta-analysis of individuals with clinically assessed or self-reported depression identifies 44 independent risk loci.

These improvements have realised a new chip which occupies less area, has a speed advantage, and consumes less power. The improvements are largely due to the management of the interconnections, the floor plan adopted, and the process technology used.

Now this design can accept a transform length twice as long as that available with the previous design, thus, it seems to be more attractive since it allows transform lengths of 64 points instead of 32 to be processed.

The minimization of the proposed local-global energy is achieved in two steps: the evolution of the foreground and background boundary curve by level set; and the robust estimation of the foreground and background model by fixed-point iteration, called quasi-semisupervised EM, which is particularly suited for the learning problem where some unknown portion of the data are labeled incorrectly.

It is important that medical students possess the correct attitude towards the elderly and not have an ageist attitude. This is because they will be caring for an increasing proportion of elderly patients. We thus sought to assess the attitudes of our medical students towards the elderly.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We conducted a cross-sectional study assessing the attitudes towards the elderly of 225 fi rst-year and 135 third-year students using a self-administered questionnaire that incorporated the Kogan's Attitudes Toward Old People Scale (KAOP). Elderly people were defined as those aged 65 years and above for this study.


RESULTS
The majority of fi rst- (98.2%) and third-year (99.2%) medical students had positive attitudes towards elderly people (KAOP score above 102). KAOP scores were not significantly different regardless of seniority (medical student year), gender, race, household income, or having a doctor-parent. Although the mean KAOP score of third-year students was higher than that of fi rst-year students, this was not significantly different (P = 0.062).


CONCLUSIONS
Medical students in Singapore have a positive attitude towards the elderly. It is important that their medical curriculum continues to have an increasing geriatric component in view of the increasing numbers of older persons that they will be caring for due to the ageing population.",69.0,4.928571428571429,False,"['-', '-', '-']","[None, None, None]","[None, None, None]","[None, None, None]",9,-1,0.0003487043026945,-1,1,0.09970757,0.5375963449478149,0.6787852048873901,0.4533971846103668,0.5381507873535156,0.3415276110172272,0.0714285714285714,2.7142857142857144,1.0,14.928571428571429,116,93.43283582089552,0.6199095022624435,0.253393665158371,1.9004524886877827,15.708219457013598

Having a cover together with partial observability does cause ambiguity about the system behaviors desired to be kept secret, yet some information about secrets may still be leaked due to statistical difference between the occurrence probabilities of the secrets and their covers. In this paper, we propose a Jensen–Shannon divergence (JSD)-based measure to quantify secrecy loss in systems modeled as partially observed stochastic discrete event systems, which quantifies the statistical difference between two distributions, one over the observations generated by secret and the other over those generated by cover. We further show that the proposed JSD measure for secrecy loss is equivalent to the mutual information between the distributions over possible observations and that over possible system status (secret versus cover). Since an adversary is likely to discriminate more if he/she observes for a longer period, our goal is to evaluate the worst case loss of secrecy as obtained in the limit over longer and longer observations.

Even in patients with closed head trauma, brain parenchyma can be severely injured due to disruption of axonal fibers by shearing forces during acceleration, deceleration, and rotation of the head. In this article we review the spectrum of imaging findings in patients with diffuse axonal injuries (DAI) after closed head trauma. Knowledge of the location and imaging characteristics of DAI is important to radiologists for detection and diagnosis. Common locations of DAI include: cerebral hemispheric gray-white matter interface and subcortical white matter, body and splenium of corpus callosum, basal ganglia, dorsolateral aspect of brainstem, and cerebellum. In the acute phase, CT may show punctate hemorrhages. The true extent of brain involvement is better appreciated with MR imaging, because both hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic lesions (gliotic scars) can be detected. The MR appearance of DAI lesions depends on several factors, including age of injury, presence of hemorrhage or blood-breakdown products (e. g., hemosiderin), and type of sequence used. Technical aspects in MR imaging of these patients are discussed. Non-hemorrhagic lesions can be detected with fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), proton-density-, or T2-weighted images, whereas gradient echo sequences with long TE increase the visibility of old hemorrhagic lesions.",255.0,10.2,True,"['-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', 'M', '-']","['David Hartley Chair of Radiology, University of Western Australia (UWA) & Royal Perth Hospital (RPH)', None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[453, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[149, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",10,-1,5.454629333911061e-05,-1,1,0.07856238,0.676727831363678,0.5127891302108765,0.4816712439060211,0.4471324384212494,0.4947132170200348,1.0,41.0,10.0,196.0,134,92.44505494505496,0.6881188118811881,0.3069306930693069,2.01980198019802,13.832752475247531

At the same time, wastewater treatment is known to be a significantly energy-intensive sector, which could potentially exploit renewable energies conversion in different forms. This study investigated the feasibility to design high renewable share wastewater treatment plants through dynamic simulations and optimization, aiming to move towards greener and energy-wise wastewater remediation processes. The main aim of the work was achieved by integrating photovoltaic systems with wind turbines, multi-energy storage technologies, i.e., batteries and hydrogen systems, and reverse osmosis tertiary treatment to absorb the power production surpluses. It was supposed that, in the newly proposed scenario, most of the plant electricity need would be covered by renewable energy. The optimization problem was multi-objective and found the trade-off solutions between minimizing the net present cost and maximizing the renewable share. In the first part of the study, the model was developed and applied to a medium-scale Italian municipal wastewater treatment plant.

In this paper we present LION, an algorithm aimed at synthesising liberal normative systems. LION's normative systems respect the agents' autonomy to the greatest possible extent, constraining their behaviour when only necessary to avoid undesirable system states. LION's norm synthesis is also driven by the need to construct compact normative systems. The key to the success of LION in this multi-objective synthesis process is that it learns about and exploits norm synergies. More precisely, LION can learn when norms are either substitutable or complementary. We show empirically that LION significantly outperforms the state of the art by synthesising normative systems that are more liberal while maintaining representation compactness.",28.0,3.5,False,"['M', 'F', '-', 'M', '-']","['University of Oxford', None, 'Professor of Artificial Intelligence, IIIA-CSIC', 'University of Oxford', 'Professor in Computing Science, University of Aberdeen, UK']","[109, None, 4975, 59510, 2074]","[14, None, 179, 858, 179]",4,-1,0.3062157543745815,-1,-1,0.11059836,0.5748058557510376,0.6167095899581909,0.4499178826808929,0.4835754930973053,0.3565095365047455,0.0,27.0,8.0,157.0,103,91.80272108843538,0.6167664670658682,0.2455089820359281,2.0,17.741000000000014

Existing approaches mainly focus on distilling information from high-level features. In this article, by contrast, we show that by integrating low-level information (e.g., color, edge junctions, texture patterns), performance can be improved with enhanced feature representation and accurately located discriminative regions. Our solution, named Attention Pyramid Convolutional Neural Network (AP-CNN), consists of 1) a dual pathway hierarchy structure with a top-down feature pathway and a bottom-up attention pathway, hence learning both high-level semantic and low-level detailed feature representation, and 2) an ROI-guided refinement strategy with ROI-guided dropblock and ROI-guided zoom-in operation, which refines features with discriminative local regions enhanced and background noises eliminated. The proposed AP-CNN can be trained end-to-end, without the need of any additional bounding box/part annotation. Extensive experiments on three popularly tested FGVC datasets (CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars, and FGVC-Aircraft) demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.

SIENA and BSI results correlated very well with gold standard data (Pearson coefficient of 0.962 and 0.969 respectively), achieving small mean absolute differences with respect to the gold standard (percentage change from baseline volume): BSI of 0.23%+/-0.26%; SIENA of 0.22%+/-0.28%.

For large structures such as the whole brain, these mean absolute differences, relative to the applied atrophy, represented similar percentages for the BSI, SIENA and FFD techniques (controls/patients): BSI, 51.99%/16.36%; SIENA, 62.34%/21.59%; FFD, 41.02%/24.95%. For small structures such as the hippocampi, these percentages were larger, especially for controls where errors were approximately equal to the small applied changes (controls/patients): FFD, 92.82%/43.61%. However, these apparently large relative errors have not prevented the global or hippocampal measures from finding significant group separation in our study. The evaluation framework presented here will help in quantifying whether the accuracy of future methodological developments is sufficient for analysing change in smaller or less atrophied local brain regions. Results obtained in our experiments with realistic simulated data confirm previously published estimates of accuracy for both evaluated global techniques. Regarding Jacobian Integration methods, the FFD-based one demonstrated promising results and potential for being used in clinical studies alongside (or in place of) the more common global methods. The generated gold standard data has also allowed us to identify some stages and sets of parameters in the evaluated techniques--the brain extraction step in the global techniques and the number of multi-resolution levels and the stopping criteria in the registration-based methods--that are critical for their accuracy.",42.0,2.8,False,"['M', '-', '-', '-', 'M', '-', '-', '-']","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",17,-1,5.851939787338751e-05,-1,1,0.12353073,0.5362593531608582,0.5257688164710999,0.4044109582901001,0.4339801371097564,0.342203289270401,1.0,117.0,18.0,499.0,283,92.5609756097561,0.6980108499095841,0.2820976491862568,1.9511754068716087,11.924560578661897

The spectrum of each series is characterized by a power-law behaviour at low frequency range, with a mean spectral exponent of about 1.5, which is rather consistent with the Kolmogorov spectrum of atmospheric turbulence. The detrended fluctuation analysis was applied on the magnitude and sign series of the increments of wind speed, in order to get information about the linear and nonlinear dynamics of the time series. Both the sign series and magnitude series are characterized by two timescale ranges; in particular the scaling exponent of the magnitude series in the high timescale range seems to be related with the height of the sensor. This study aims to understand better high frequency wind speed in urban areas and to disclose the underlying mechanism governing the wind fluctuations at different heights.",2.0,0.4,False,"['M', 'M', 'M', '-', 'M']","[None, 'University of Lausanne', None, None, None]","[None, 34, None, None, None]","[None, 16, None, None, None]",14,-1,5.518923229906055e-05,-1,1,0.086072564,0.6892027854919434,0.7112499475479126,0.5527976155281067,0.6874643564224243,0.464237242937088,1.0,13.0,6.0,157.0,88,87.23404255319149,0.5838509316770186,0.2236024844720497,1.7701863354037266,25.206236024844745

The neural networks are composed of synapses and neurons. For mimicking synapses, memristors have been studied intensively many years as a potential candidate of hardware realization. The 3-dimensional connectivity in memristor crossbars seems very similar to the real neuronal structure in human's brain. In addition, memristor crossbars can calculate the weighted summation in parallel. This is very useful in performing Vector-Matrix Multiplication in crossbars like brain's parallel computation. For non-ideal effects, memristor crossbars can be susceptible to various variations in synaptic memristance, parasitic resistance, etc. We analyze and discuss these variations in memristor crossbars, in this paper, in terms of neural network's performance. For completing the neural networks, not only synapses but also neurons should be implemented. To do so, we consider the non-ideal effects of two CMOS neuron circuits which perform ReLU and Sigmoid activation functions, respectively. Because the circuit elements of CMOS neurons can also be susceptible to various Process-Voltage-Temperature variations, we analyze and discuss these effects. And, we combine all the non-ideal effects in Memristor-CMOS hybrid circuits and analyze how they affect the network's performance.

Image Represent.,"In this paper, highly nonlinear, fuzzy based composite scheme is proposed.In the pre-processing part, a newly designed 55 HPF is used recursively.A Fuzzy based post-processing scheme is also developed based on local statistics.The nonlinearity of FIS is enhanced by varying its parameters for better HF restoration.The proposed scheme is meant for both online and off-line applications. In this paper, a highly nonlinear, fuzzy logic based, composite scheme is proposed by combining a pre-processing and a post-processing operation to efficiently restore high frequency (HF) and very high frequency (VHF) details in an up-scaled image. The blurring in case of an up-sampled image is caused by the degradation of HF and VHF image details that correspond to fine details and edge regions during the up-sampling process. The degradation of HF and VHF image details is more significant than that of the flat and slowly varying regions. In order to resolve this problem effectively, a fuzzy composite scheme is developed which is based on the inverse modeling approach of HF degradation. During the pre-processing operation, the VHF components of an image are boosted up using recursive Laplacian of Laplacian (LOL) operator prior to image up-scaling. Subsequent to the image up-scaling, a fuzzy local adaptive Laplacian post-processing scheme is used which enhances the HF image details more than the low frequency image details based on local statistics in the up-scaled image. The HF restoration performance of the fuzzy based composite scheme is enhanced by improving its nonlinearity through the variations of different parameters of the fuzzy inference system (FIS) such as slope, width and the number of input-, and output membership functions. The effective fusion of pre-processing and post-processing operations makes the proposed scheme much effective to tackle the non-uniform blurring than the standalone pre-processing and post-processing techniques. Experimental results reveal that the proposed composite scheme gives much less blurring in comparison to the standalone schemes and performs better than most of the widely used interpolation schemes in terms of objective and subjective measures.",2.0,0.3333333333333333,False,"['M', '-']","[None, 'National Institute of Technology Rourkela']","[None, 808]","[None, 78]",14,1,5.7837665669557225e-05,-1,1,0.1344049,0.5668330788612366,0.6377226710319519,0.6168087124824524,0.467980682849884,0.322789192199707,1.0,51.0,14.0,330.0,143,87.78614457831326,0.6164772727272727,0.2670454545454545,1.9147727272727275,11.350227272727295

To explore the feasibility of directionally inducing human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAD-MSCs) towards inner ear hair cells.


METHODS
Mesenchymal stem cells from human adipose tissue were isolated, purified and cultured in vitro. hAD-MSCs were induced to neural stem/progenitor-like cell, and then co-cultured with embryonic chick otic vesicle cells. Processed hAD-MSCs were tested by immunostaining to ascertain whether they expressed characteristic hair cell markers.


RESULTS
Morphologically, hAD-MSCs were induced to differentiate into neural stem/progenitor cells and expressed specific neural markers. After being co-cultured with embryonic chick otic vesicle cells, hAD-MSCs expressed specific surface markers of inner ear hair cells.


CONCLUSIONS
hAD-MSCs can be directionally induced to differentiate towards hair cell-like cells in vitro.",2.0,0.1428571428571428,False,"['-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-']","[None, 'Research Assistant of Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, 58, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, 82, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",21,-1,0.0015639360362077,-1,-1,0.05314134,0.4453740119934082,0.5817099809646606,0.3992718756198883,0.3865377604961395,0.3770346343517303,0.1428571428571428,1.8571428571428568,0.7857142857142857,8.142857142857142,63,92.89719626168224,0.7322834645669292,0.3070866141732283,2.0393700787401574,-4.265708661417278

During the non-learning-based approaches, the techniques based on the partial differential equations and calculus of variation have attracted a lot of attention and acquired many achievements. Among the variational models, the Chan-Vese variational segmentation is a well-known model to solve the image segmentation problem. The level set methods are highly accurate methods to solve this model, and they do not depend on the edges. However, the performance of these methods depends on the level set function and its initial boundary too much. In this paper, we propose automatic initial boundary generation methods based on the edge detectors: Sobel, Prewitt, Roberts and Canny. In the experiments, we prove that among the four proposed initial boundary generation methods, the method based on the Canny edge detector brings the highest performance for the segmentation method. By combining the proposed initial boundary generation method based on the Canny edge detector, we implement the Chan-Vese model to segment biomedical images. Experimental results indicate we obtain improved segmentation results and compare different edge detectors in terms of performance.",23.0,5.75,False,"['-', '-', '-', '-', '-']","['University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City, Department of Information Technology (BIS)', None, ""Assistant Professor, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati"", ""Assistant Professor, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati"", None, None]","[203, None, 1125, 1125, None, None]","[33, None, 153, 153, None, None]",25,-1,6.709224499600876e-05,-1,-1,0.020276664,0.6349093914031982,0.6609304547309875,0.4690714180469513,0.5570521354675293,0.5401317477226257,0.0,26.0,9.0,198.0,108,88.16939890710383,0.6305418719211823,0.2955665024630542,2.019704433497537,13.63800492610838

Multiple medical specialties rely on image data, typically following the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) ISO 12052 standard, to support diagnosis through telemedicine. Remote analysis by different physicians requires the same image to be transmitted simultaneously to different destinations in real-time. This scenario poses a need for a large number of resources to store and transmit DICOM images in real-time, which has been explored using some cloud-based solutions. However, these solutions lack strategies to improve the performance through the cloud elasticity feature. In this context, this article proposes a cloud-based publish/subscribe (PubSub) model, called PS2DICOM, which employs multilevel resource elasticity to improve the performance of DICOM data transmissions.


METHODS
A prototype is implemented to evaluate PS2DICOM. A PubSub communication model is adopted, considering the coexistence of two classes of users: (i) image data producers (publishers); and (ii) image data consumers (subscribers). PS2DICOM employs a cloud infrastructure to guarantee service availability and performance through resource elasticity in two levels of the cloud: (i) brokers and (ii) data storage. In addition, images are compressed prior to the transmission to reduce the demand for network resources using one of three different algorithms: (i) DEFLATE, (ii) LZMA, and (iii) BZIP2. PS2DICOM employs dynamic data compression levels at the client side to improve network performance according to the current available network throughput.


RESULTS
Results indicate that PS2DICOM can improve transmission quality, storage capabilities, querying, and retrieving of DICOM images. The general efficiency gain is approximately 35% in data sending and receiving operations. This gain is resultant from the two levels of elasticity, allowing resources to be scaled up or down automatically in a transparent manner.


CONCLUSIONS
The contributions of PS2DICOM are twofold: (i) multilevel cloud elasticity to adapt the computing resources on demand; (ii) adaptive data compression to meet the network quality and optimize data transmission. Results suggest that the use of compression in medical image data using PS2DICOM can improve the transmission efficiency, allowing the team of specialists to communicate in real-time, even when they are geographically distant.",1.0,0.3333333333333333,False,"['-', '-', 'M', '-', '-', '-']","[None, None, 'Unisinos', None, None, None]","[None, None, 137, None, None, None]","[None, None, 23, None, None, None]",12,-1,6.709224499600876e-05,-1,1,0.061667126,0.5900190472602844,0.5203511714935303,0.5099250674247742,0.5151742100715637,0.3855974078178406,0.2142857142857142,5.071428571428571,1.3571428571428572,24.214285714285715,176,93.24615384615385,0.663768115942029,0.3710144927536232,2.1536231884057973,-4.0860217391304445

To this end, a method for detecting skin colors under varying illumination is proposed in this paper. First, spatial illumination variation is identified and the images are segmented into different regions with different illumination. Each illumination region of color images are corrected base on the illuminant estimated by a local edge-based color constancy algorithm. Then, the corrected images are transformed into a color-space, where statistical results on a skin dataset show that the skin color cluster and non-skin color clusters are separated. Finally, the skin colors are modeled under Bayesian decision framework and classified from non-skin colors. The experimental results show that the proposed method is robust to illumination variations.",4.0,0.3333333333333333,False,"['-', 'M', '-', 'M']","['National Engineering Research Center for E-Learning，Central China Normal University', 'The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen', None, None]","[9, 650, None, None]","[14, 39, None, None]",6,-1,5.454629333911061e-05,-1,-1,0.03746914,0.2750847935676575,0.3331824541091919,0.2582378983497619,0.3079567849636078,0.2548777759075165,1.0,19.0,8.0,156.0,90,89.07142857142857,0.6125,0.29375,2.01875,16.25625000000005

On the one hand, the controlled robotic system provides strength and accuracy, holding the tool, keeping the right tool orientation and guaranteeing a smooth approach to the workpiece. On the other hand, the advanced teleoperation provides security and comfort to the user when performing the task. In particular, the proposed teleoperation uses augmented virtuality (i.e., a virtual world that includes non-modeled real-world data) and haptic feedback to provide the user an immersive virtual experience when remotely teleoperating the tool of the robot system to treat arbitrary regions of the workpiece surface. The method is illustrated with a car body surface treatment operation, although it can be easily extended to other surface treatment applications or even to other industrial tasks where the human operator may benefit from robotic assistance.

As advanced Cloud services are becoming mainstream, the contribution of data centers in the overall power consumption of modern cities is growing dramatically. These facilities consume from 10 to 100 times more power per square foot than typical office buildings. Modeling the power consumption for these infrastructures is crucial to anticipate the effects of aggressive optimization policies, but accurate and fast power modeling is a complex challenge for high-end servers not yet satisfied by analytical approaches. For this case study, our methodology minimizes error in power prediction. This work has been tested using real Cloud applications resulting on an average error in power estimation of 3.98%.

A content-based sub-system provides two types of clusters, equivalent items and virtual users, to overcome a disadvantage of social filtering, that is, a shortage of ratings. Since items similar in visual properties are not always similar in user tastes, a social sub-system controls the content-based sub-system with an evaluation function that estimates the validity of content-based clusters according to user ratings. Based on this approach, we have developed an image database, Web Graphics Navigator, that recommends graphics for Web pages according to the users' tastes.

The intention is to use the Cloud Application as a platform and try to create a partner eco-system around the platform. The CSPs can select companies or solutions that add high business value to the platform in turn increasing value of partnering solutions.

Catalog management includes adding/deleting/importing/exporting offerings, managing offering related attributes, managing access controls etc. Once the new service is provisioned, it becomes available to customers of Service Providers.

Saliency information is used to guide the integration process. The multi-scale saliency of a point is specifically designed to reflect its sensitivity to registration errors. Then scans are partitioned into salient and non-salient regions through an Markov Random Field (MRF) framework where neighbourhood consistency is incorporated to increase the robustness against potential scanning errors. We then develop different schemes to discriminatively integrate points in the two regions.

GRASP is premised on the inevitability of conflicts during search and its most distinguishing feature is the augmentation of basic backtracking search with a powerful conflict analysis procedure. Analyzing conflicts to determine their causes enables GRASP to backtrack non-chronologically to earlier levels in the search tree, potentially pruning large portions of the search space. In addition, by “recording” the causes of conflicts, GRASP can recognize and preempt the occurrence of similar conflicts later on in the search. Finally, straightforward bookkeeping of the causality chains leading up to conflicts allows GRASP to identify assignments that are necessary for a solution to be found. Experimental results obtained from a large number of benchmarks indicate that application of the proposed conflict analysis techniques to SAT algorithms can be extremely effective for a large number of representative classes of SAT instances.

This process can be treated as an optimization problem, aiming to find a subset of TCs which optimizes one or more objective functions (i.e., selection criteria). The majority of search-based works focus on single-objective selection. In this light, we developed a mechanism for functional TC selection which considers two objectives simultaneously: maximize requirements' coverage while minimizing cost in terms of TC execution effort. This mechanism was implemented as a multi-objective optimization process based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). We implemented two multi-objective versions of PSO (BMOPSO and BMOPSO-CDR).

In this study, we extend our emergent emotion model to propose that the robot’s trust in the interaction partner (i.e., trustee) can be established by the effect of the interactions on the computational energy budget of the robot (i.e., trustor). To be concrete, we show how high-level emotions (e.g., wellbeing) of an agent can be modeled by the computational cost of perceptual processing (e.g., visual stimulus processing for visual recalling) in a decision-making framework. To realize this approach, we endow the Pepper humanoid robot with two modules: an auto-associative memory that extracts the required computational energy to perform a visual recalling, and an internal reward mechanism guiding model-free reinforcement learning to yield computational energy cost-aware behaviors. With this setup, the robot interacts with online instructors with different guiding strategies, namely reliable, less reliable, and random. Through interaction with the instructors, the robot associates the cumulative reward values based on the cost of perceptual processing to evaluate the instructors and determine which one should be trusted. Overall the results indicate that the robot can differentiate the guiding strategies of the instructors.

We identify a novel class of independence structures, called riffled independence, which encompasses a more expressive family of distributions while retaining many of the properties necessary for performing efficient inference and reducing sample complexity. In riffled independence, one draws two permutations independently, then performs the riffle shuffle, common in card games, to combine the two permutations to form a single permutation. In ranking, riffled independence corresponds to ranking disjoint sets of objects independently, then interleaving those rankings.

In general, given two polygons with a correspondence between their vertices, two polygonal decompositions of the two polygons are said to be compatible if there exists a one-to-one mapping between them such that the corresponding pieces are defined by corresponding vertices. For compatible star decompositions, they also require correspondence between star points of the star pieces. Compatible star decompositions have applications in computer animation and shape representation and analysis. They present two algorithms for constructing compatible star decompositions of two simple polygons. The first algorithm is optimal in the number of pieces in the decomposition, providing that such a decomposition exists without adding Steiner vertices. The second algorithm constructs compatible star decompositions with Steiner vertices, which are not minimal in the number of pieces but are asymptotically worst-case optimal in this number and in the number of added Steiner vertices. They prove that some pairs of polygons require /spl Omega/(n/sup 2/) pieces, and that the decompositions computed by the second algorithm possess no more than O(n/sup 2/) pieces. In addition to the contributions regarding compatible star decompositions, the paper also corrects an error in the only previously published polynomial algorithm for constructing a minimal star decomposition of a simple polygon, an error which might lead to a nonminimal decomposition.",24.0,0.9230769230769232,False,"['M', 'M']","[None, 'Associate Professor of Computer Science, The Hebrew University']","[None, 106]","[None, 31]",7,-1,5.649793328376295e-05,-1,1,0.20517528,0.6767278909683228,0.6781654953956604,0.5078814625740051,0.6383002996444702,0.5891467332839966,1.0,24.0,9.0,221.0,103,88.9423076923077,0.5964912280701754,0.293859649122807,2.043859649122807,8.955473684210546

In some smaller observational cohort studies and case reports, general an‐ aesthesia use has been shown to have no negative effect on be‐ haviour and cognition,5 yet others reported association of general anaesthetic agents with learning disabilities.6‐8 Most cohort studies are hampered with small numbers and varied population as well as variable outcome measures, making their generalisability restricted. This is the first multicentre, randomised controlled equivalence trial comparing the effects of general vs regional anaesthesia on neurodevelopmental outcomes for newborns greater than 26‐week gestation and younger than 60 weeks postmenstrual age, that un‐ derwent inguinal hernia repair. The trial showed strong evidence for equivalence in both primary and secondary outcomes measured at 2 years (interim analysis) and then at the 5‐year follow‐up. A major strength of this study is its size, possible only with mul‐ ticentre collaboration lending strong credibility to the results. Other strengths would be the use of comprehensive analytical techniques such as multiple imputations to account for missing data and loss to follow‐up. The analysis was done on a per‐protocol basis adjusting for gestational age at birth and country, and an intention to treat analysis was also performed on both subsets. The conduct of this trial is elab‐ orate and commendable. A major limitation of the study is that it only reviews a single ex‐ posure of an anaesthetic agent for less than 1 hour in predominantly male infants, whereas all previous preclinical and clinical evidence alludes to a dose‐dependent adverse effect of anaesthetic agents. Thus, the scientific community needs to exercise prudence in ex‐ trapolating these results to infants who are older, require multiple doses and/or multiple neurotropic drugs in the same surgery, mul‐ tiple surgeries requiring repeated anaesthetic exposure as well as prolonged exposure to these agents. It should also be noted that de‐ spite the best efforts of the authors, the sample size of 598 infants was not met for the primary outcome (447 complete assessments at 5 years). A sensitivity analysis might have been reassuring, if full sample size had been attained and results showed minimal change in outcome. The study establishes that single, short‐duration exposure (<60 minutes) to sevoflurane general anaesthesia does not lead to different neurodevelopmental outcomes as assessed by the WPPSI‐ III when compared to awake‐regional anaesthesia for infants under‐ going inguinal hernia repair. Determining the dose‐dependent effect of anaesthesia on neuronal development would require the designing of a thoughtfully constructed trial delineating the complex surgical neonates from those that require uncomplicated surgical procedures.",4.0,1.0,False,"['-', '-']","[None, None]","[None, None]","[None, None]",29,1,0.000129315639546,-1,1,0.08505233,0.5887430906295776,0.5693586468696594,0.4417813718318939,0.5246897339820862,0.3393070995807647,1.0,38.0,20.0,508.0,299,95.33663366336634,0.6438095238095238,0.3085714285714285,2.0228571428571427,1.292785714285742

Though often ignored, we have found that appropriate pair selection is crucial to maximising training efficiency, particularly in scenarios where examples are limited. In this paper, we study the role of informed pair selection and propose a 2-phased strategy of exploration and exploitation. Random sampling provides the needed coverage for exploration, while areas of uncertainty modeled by neighbourhood properties of the pairs drive exploitation.

In consequence, we suggest to implement cooperative interfaces to enable automated driving even with imperfect automation. We recommend to consider four basic requirements for driver–vehicle cooperation: mutual predictability, directability, shared situation representation, and calibrated trust in automation. We present research that can be seen as a step towards cooperative interfaces in regard to these requirements.

The focus measure plays important role in SFF algorithms. Mostly, conventional focus measures are based on gradient, so their performance is restricted under noisy conditions. Moreover, SFF methods also suffer from loss of focus information due to discreteness. This paper introduces a new SFF method based on principal component analysis (PCA) and kernel regression. The focus values are computed through PCA by considering a sequence of small 3D neighborhood for each object point. We apply unsupervised regression through Nadaraya and Watson Estimate (NWE) on depth values to get a refined 3D shape of the object. It reduces the effect of noise within a small surface area as well as approximates the accurate 3D shape by exploiting the depth dependencies in the neighborhood.

Managing the pathways through which alien species arrive and spread is important to reduce the threat of biological invasions. Harmonising information on pathways across individual sectors and user groups is therefore critical to underpin policy and action. The European Alien Species Information Network (EASIN) has been developed to easily facilitate open access to data of alien species in Europe. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Pathway Classification framework has become a global standard for the classification of pathways. We followed a structured approach to assign pathway information within EASIN for a subset of alien species in Europe, which covered 4169 species, spanning taxonomic groups and environments. We document constraints and challenges associated with implementing the CBD Pathway Classification framework and propose potential amendments to increase clarity. This study is unique in the scope of taxonomic coverage and also in the inclusion of primary (independent introductions to Europe) and secondary (means of dispersal for species expansion within Europe, after their initial introduction) modes of introduction. In addition, we summarise the patterns of introduction pathways within this subset of alien species within the context of Europe.

The Termolator combines several different approaches to get superior coverage and precision. The in-line term component identifies potential instances of terminology using a chunking procedure, similar to noun group chunking, but favoring chunks that contain out-of-vocabulary words, nominalizations, technical adjectives, and other specialized word classes. The distributional component ranks such term chunks according to several metrics including: (a) a set of metrics that favors term chunks that are relatively more frequent in a “foreground” corpus about a single topic than they are in a “background” or multi-topic corpus; (b) a well-formedness score based on linguistic features and (c) a relevance score which measures how often terms appear in articles and patents in a Yahoo web search. We analyse the contributions made by each of these components and show that all modules contribute to the system’s performance, both in terms of the number and quality of terms identified. This paper expands upon previous publications about this research and includes descriptions of some of the improvements made since its initial release. This study also includes a comparison with another terminology extraction system available on-line, Termostat (Drouin 2003).. We found that the systems get comparable results when applied to small amounts of data: about 50% precision for a single foreground file (Einstein’s Theory of Relativity). However, when running the system with 500 patent files as foreground, Termolator performed significantly better than Termostat. For 500 refrigeration patents, Termolator got 70% precision vs Termostat’s 52%. For 500 semiconductor patents, Termolator got 79% precision vs Termostat’s 51%.",12.0,2.4,False,"['M', '-', 'F', '-']","[None, 'University of Alicante, Hofstra University, Augusta State University', 'New York University', None]","[None, 10, 309, None]","[None, 3, 22, None]",13,-1,6.108855101648565e-05,-1,1,0.19700499,0.4829568862915039,0.689436674118042,0.6355020999908447,0.4625779390335083,0.4586764276027679,0.0,48.0,11.0,263.0,170,91.98039215686276,0.64,0.2909090909090909,2.0,13.37650000000002

Ninety-seven consecutive patients (62 men; mean age, 58 ± 15 years) with histologically proven glioblastoma underwent 1.5T-MRI, including anatomical, diffusion-weighted, dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion, and 3D-T1CE sequences after 0.1 mmol/kg gadobutrol.

These networks have non-uniform transmission ranges and are modeled using directed disk graphs. The corresponding graph theoretic problem seeks a strongly connected dominating-absorbent set of minimum cardinality in a digraph. A subset of nodes in a digraph is a strongly connected dominating-absorbent set if the subgraph induced by these nodes is strongly connected and each node in the graph is either in the set or has both an in-neighbor and an out-neighbor in it. Due to the dynamic nature of ad-hoc networks, distributed algorithms for this problem are of practical significance. Hence, we seek algorithms that do not require centralized computation and yet yield good approximation factors and/or behave well in practice.

Our contributions consist of several aspects: First, the use of an affine invariant feature, edge-corner, is introduced to provide a robust and consistent matching primitives. Second, based on SVD decomposition of affine matrix, the affine matching space between two corners can be approximately divided into two independent spaces by rotation angle and scaling factor. Employing this property, a two-stage affine matching algorithm is designed to obtain robust matches over two frames. Third, using the epipolar geometry estimated by these matches, more corresponding feature points are determined. Based on these robust correspondences, the fundamental matrix is refined, and a series of virtual views of the scene are synthesized. Finally, several experiments are presented to illustrate that a number of robust correspondences can be stably determined for two wide baseline images under significant camera motions with illumination changes, occlusions, and self-similarities. After testing a number of examples and comparing with the existing methods, the experimental results strongly demonstrate that our matching method outperforms the state-of-art algorithms for all of the test cases.",112.0,5.6,False,['-'],"['Professor of Ningbo Industrial Technology Research Institutes, CAS', 'Trustee Chair Professor of Computer Science, University of Central Florida']","[None, None]","[4, 138]",4,-1,9.387641443080778e-05,-1,-1,0.052648943,0.3440743386745453,0.460325539112091,0.2993750274181366,0.5063785910606384,0.3047245740890503,1.0,28.0,9.0,189.0,121,94.77011494252874,0.6443298969072165,0.3092783505154639,2.128865979381444,2.778938144329913

For each controller we develop at least one behavior primitive that determines how the controller outputs translate to specific movements of the agent. Additionally we provide at least one perceptual proxy that defines the representation of the object that is to be computed as input to the controller during execution. A variety of proxies may be selected for a given controller and a given proxy may provide input more than one controller.

Conclusion: Children from high- and low-risk areas of Italy have incidence rates of T1D that are closer to those of their native regions than to those of German children, indicating that genetic factors play a predominant role in the pathogenesis of T1D.",1.0,0.0714285714285714,False,"['-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-']","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",22,1,5.412183369044865e-05,-1,1,0.10448299,0.5917467474937439,0.5006668567657471,0.4772208929061889,0.5431493520736694,0.3014118671417236,0.0,64.0,5.0,242.0,123,86.29213483146067,0.7282229965156795,0.1951219512195122,1.7491289198606272,23.739693379790964

A circular order of elements of X corresponds to a circular (clockwise) scanning of the subset X of vertices of a tree drawn on a plane. This paper describes an optimal algorithm using circular orders to compare the topology of two trees given by their distance matrices. This algorithm allows us to compute the Robinson and Foulds topologic distance between two trees. It employs circular order tree reconstruction to compute an ordered bipartition table of the tree edges for both given distance matrices. These bipartition tables are then compared to determine the Robinson and Foulds topologic distance, known to be an important criterion of tree similarity. The described algorithm has optimal time complexity, requiring O(n(2)) time when performed on two n x n distance matrices.

To handle this issue, this paper proposes a new coarse-to-fine single image deraining framework termed Multi-stream Hybrid Deraining Network (shortly, MH-DerainNet). To obtain the negative rain streaks during training process more accurately, we present a new module named dual path residual dense block, i.e., Residual path and Dense path. The Residual path is used to reuse com-mon features from the previous layers while the Dense path can explore new features. In addition, to concatenate different scaled features, we also apply the idea of multi-stream with shortcuts between cascaded dual path residual dense block based streams. To obtain more distinct derained images, we combine the SSIM loss and perceptual loss to preserve the per-pixel similarity as well as preserving the global structures so that the deraining result is more accurate.

Ensembles of classifiers have been shown to be able to improve the predictive accuracy as well as the robustness of single classification methods. In this work novel incremental variants of several well-known classifier fusion methods (Fuzzy Integral, Decision Templates, Dempster-Shafer Combination and Discounted Dempster-Shafer Combination) are presented. Furthermore, a novel incremental classifier fusion method called Incremental Direct Cluster-based ensemble will be introduced, which exploits an evolving clustering approach. A flexible and interactive framework for on-line learning will be introduced, in which the ensemble methods are adapted incrementally in a sample-wise manner together with their base classifiers.

Because of its polyphagous feeding habit, mobility as adults, and high fecundity, the expanding infestations of H. armigera in different crops have caused economic losses and difficulties for pest population management. In Brazil, a sequence of different crop systems in the same area and crop rotation during the year can create a spatio-temporal mosaic of crops where H. armigera can persist. However, the consequences of the simultaneous and/or alternating presence of host plants for H. armigera populations through generations are unknown. In this study, we simulated, in the laboratory, hypothetical situations for the availability of soybean and cotton crops in the landscape. We evaluated the effects of: (1) the number of generations during which a population feeds on a host-plant species; (2) the succession of host-plant species on which populations have fed for two generations; and (3) the parental host plant on the fitness of H. armigera populations. Only the current host plant on which larvae fed affected the performance of the H. armigera populations. Decrease of mortality rates during the immature period was slowed when the larvae fed on soybean. The lowest value of reproductive potential (R0) was found for individuals originating from mating between females and males reared in cotton.

The solutions to the problems discussed are based on a representation of musical rhythms where pulses are viewed as points equally spaced around the circumference of a circle and onsets are a subset of the pulses. All our results for rhythms apply equally well to scales, and many of the problems we explore are interesting in their own right as distance geometry problems on the circle. 
In this thesis, we characterize two families of rhythms called deep and Euclidean. We describe three algorithms that generate the unique Euclidean rhythm for a given number of onsets and pulses, and show that Euclidean rhythms are formed of repeating patterns of a Euclidean rhythm with fewer onsets, followed possibly by a different rhythmic pattern. We then study the conditions under which we can transform one Euclidean rhythm to another through five different operations. In the context of measuring rhythmic similarity, we discuss the necklace alignment problem where the goal is to find rotations of two rhythms and a perfect matching between the onsets that minimizes some norm of the circular distance between the matched points. We provide o (n2)-time algorithms to this problem using each of the e1, e2, and e∞ norms as distance measures. Finally, we give a polynomial-time solution to the labeled beltway problem where we are given the ordering of a set of points around the circumference of a circle and a labeling of all distances defined by pairs of points, and we want to construct a rhythm such that two distances with a common onset as endpoint have the same length if and only if they have the same label.",1.0,0.0666666666666666,False,['-'],['Element AI'],[25],[14],6,-1,5.716387497308454e-05,-1,1,0.12839486,0.487050861120224,0.6309939622879028,0.4420187473297119,0.3874796330928802,0.5445539355278015,1.0,10.0,4.5,144.0,147,90.72222222222224,0.5206896551724138,0.196551724137931,1.7344827586206897,23.55775862068967

With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book.

This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression and path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates.

Most research in massive MIMO just uses the extended conventional MIMO channel model by directly assuming that the channel dimensionality becomes large. With massive numbers of antennas, however, there exists a non-negligible propagation delay across the large array aperture, which then causes a transmitted symbol to reach different antennas with different delays, thereby rendering conventional MIMO channel models inapplicable. Such a phenomenon is known as the spatial-wideband effect in the areas of array signal processing and radar signal processing, and introduces the beam squint effect in beamforming. However, the spatial-wideband effect and the related beam squint issue are seldom studied in massive MIMO communications. To design a practical massive MIMO system, it is important to understand when the spatial-wideband effect appears and how it affects signal transmission, how the spatial-wideband effect interacts with the frequency-wideband effect (frequency selectivity), especially for multi-carrier modulations such as orthogonal frequency- division multiplexing (OFDM), and how we should re-design the transceiver.

In this paper, we show, for the first time, that such point clouds retain enough information to reveal scene appearance and compromise privacy. We present a privacy attack that reconstructs color images of the scene from the point cloud. Our method is based on a cascaded U-Net that takes as input, a 2D multichannel image of the points rendered from a specific viewpoint containing point depth and optionally color and SIFT descriptors and outputs a color image of the scene from that viewpoint.

Sialorrhea is problematic for neurologically impaired children, and botulinum toxin A salivary gland injection has been reported as effective in reducing sialorrhea. This article assesses the success and safety of ultrasound-guided weight-based botulinum toxin A injection for the management of sialorrhea in children.


METHODS
A total of 111 patients (63 males; 48 females; average age 7 years) with refractory sialorrhea were treated with ultrasound-guided botulinum toxin type A salivary gland injections (144 procedures) from July 1, 2004, to July 1, 2014, using a single weight-based protocol. Patient history, procedural records, and clinical follow-up documents were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical data were compared with reported effectiveness and complications using odds ratios.


RESULTS
A total of 144 procedures were performed in 111 patients with refractory sialorrhea. Cerebral palsy was the most common underlying etiology for sialorrhea (29%), whereas others included encephalopathy (5%), anoxic brain injury (4%), and a variety of chromosomal anomalies (5%). There was a 100% technical success rate. Overall treatment effectiveness was 68%. Repeat injections were not associated with increased clinical success. No procedure-related deaths or major complications were identified; the minor complication rate was less than 2%.


CONCLUSIONS
The protocol used for ultrasound-guided injection of botulinum toxin A proved to be safe and effective in children suffering from sialorrhea. Image guidance technique may lead to a reduction in rates of adverse events reported in other series. Subsequent procedures do not improve upon initial efficacy.",31.0,4.428571428571429,False,"['-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-']","['Stanford University', None, None, None, None, None]","[290, None, None, None, None, None]","[46, None, None, None, None, None]",24,1,0.0601970501605389,-1,1,0.107723325,0.6662255525588989,0.5773679614067078,0.4245715737342834,0.4484158754348755,0.3919037878513336,0.1428571428571428,3.7857142857142856,1.2857142857142858,16.785714285714285,147,95.13513513513512,0.6942148760330579,0.3636363636363636,2.169421487603306,1.5809421487603288

The usage of Computer-Assisted Orthopedic Surgical (CAOS) techniques by surgeons is rapidly growing. CAOS enhance the Hip Resurfacing or Hip Replacement process, since automatic systems increase surgical tasks precision and accuracy.

Without any effort towards load management as well as Demand Side Management (DSM) strategies implementation, the dedicative consumers' electricity bill has increased significantly to approximately 0.5%–12% during ETOU tariff shifting. In order to overcome this issue, a novel formulation by using simultaneous demand side management strategies such as valley filling, load clipping and load shifting for the ETOU tariff optimization is proposed.

Survival analysis methods that integrate pathways/gene sets into their learning model could identify molecular mechanisms that determine survival characteristics of patients. Rather than first picking the predictive pathways/gene sets from a given collection and then training a predictive model on the subset of genomic features mapped to these selected pathways/gene sets, we developed a novel machine learning algorithm (Path2Surv) that conjointly performs these two steps using multiple kernel learning.


RESULTS
We extensively tested our Path2Surv algorithm on 7655 patients from 20 cancer types using cancer-specific pathway/gene set collections and gene expression profiles of these patients. Path2Surv statistically significantly outperformed survival random forest (RF) on 12 out of 20 datasets and obtained comparable predictive performance against survival support vector machine (SVM) using significantly fewer gene expression features (i.e. less than 10% of what survival RF and survival SVM used).

Our implementations of survival SVM and Path2Surv algorithms in R are available at https://github.com/mehmetgonen/path2surv together with the scripts that replicate the reported experiments.

The strength of the bond depends on the instructional design of the feedback. Feedback is central to medical education in promoting self-directed learning in students. In the present study, a structured verbal feedback module was prepared, implemented, and evaluated. Methods: The study was done on 280 students from four consecutive batches (2011 to 2014) of the 1st year MBBS students exposed to different types and modes of feedback. Analysis was done using student feedback questionnaire for the perception of students to verbal feedback. Quantitative analysis using post hoc test and ANOVA for the impact of type of feedback (verbal or written) and effect of modes (individual or group) of verbal feedback on test score performance were done. Result: In this study, ≥95% of the students preferred verbal feedback of both positive and negative attributes in student questionnaires. It was observed that verbal feedback sessions made a difference of up to 2–2.4 grade points in the mean score of batch when compared to the written feedback. The initial mean test score (T1) of 2011 + 2012 and 2013 + 2014 was not statistically significant (P = 0.113).

Effective placement of data centers improves network performance and minimizes clients' perceived latency. The problem of determining the optimal placement of data centers in a large network is a classical uncapacitated $k$-median problem. Traditional works have focused on centralized algorithms, which requires knowledge of the overall network topology and information about the customers' service demands. Moreover, centralized algorithms are computationally expensive and do not scale well with the size of the network. We propose a fully distributed algorithm with linear complexity to optimize the locations of data centers. The proposed algorithm utilizes an iterative two-step optimization approach. Specifically, in each iteration, it first partitions the whole network into $k$ regions through a distributed partitioning algorithm; then within each region, it determines the local approximate optimal location through a distributed message-passing algorithm. When the underlying network is a tree topology, we show that the overall cost is monotonically decreasing between successive iterations and the proposed algorithm converges in a finite number of iterations. Extensive simulations on both synthetic and real Internet topologies show that the proposed algorithm achieves performance comparable with that of centralized algorithms that require global information and have higher computational complexity.",2.0,0.4,False,"['-', '-', 'M', '-']","['AI Lab @ OCBC Bank', 'PhD candidate, Scientific Developer', None, None]","[319, 1331, None, None]","[13, 16, None, None]",11,-1,6.205049602300741e-05,-1,-1,0.061069056,0.423162579536438,0.6524657607078552,0.4531599879264831,0.5349240899085999,0.4411484003067016,0.0,23.0,10.0,207.0,124,92.21052631578948,0.6285714285714286,0.4047619047619047,2.2523809523809524,-4.7269285714285445

In this paper, we introduce a new approach that automatically reconstructs the 3D shape and rectifies a deformed text document from a single image. We first estimate the 2D distortion grid in an image by exploiting the line structure and stroke statistics in text documents. This approach does not rely on more noise-sensitive operations such as image binarization and character segmentation. The regularity in the text pattern is used to constrain the 2D distortion grid to be a perspective projection of a 3D parallelogram mesh. Based on this constraint, we present a new shape-from-texture method that computes the 3D deformation up to a scale factor using SVD. Unlike previous work, this formulation imposes no restrictions on the shape (e.g., a developable surface). The estimated shape is then used to remove both geometric distortions and photometric (shading) effects in the image.

To address these problems, we develop a novel approach called CoPath that leverages genomic alteration profiles and bi-clustering to discover cooperative driver pathways. Based on the mutation profiles reconstructed from somatic mutations and copy number variations, CoPath firstly uses a greedy search on the gene signaling network to identify mutually exclusive modules of genes, which have common downstream events in the network. Next, it incorporates the identified mutually exclusive modules and gene interaction network as prior knowledge, and introduces a dual regularized bi-clustering method on gene expression data to cluster cooperative mutually exclusive modules. Finally, it identifies the modules in the same cluster as cooperative driver pathways. Extensive experiments on real cancer genomics dataset (Breast from TCGA) shows that CoPath can not only detect individual driver pathways but also uncover more relations between potential driver genes and pathways than related competitive approaches.",1.0,0.25,False,"['-', '-', '-', '-', 'F']","[None, 'Professor, School of Software, Shandong University, Jinan, China', None, None, None]","[None, 994, None, None, None]","[None, 91, None, None, None]",12,-1,8.992845191712828e-05,-1,-1,0.10907189,0.5054879784584045,0.519146203994751,0.5506471395492554,0.4903886318206787,0.5115435719490051,0.0,24.0,8.0,195.0,124,93.59550561797752,0.6767676767676768,0.3535353535353535,2.237373737373737,-7.212818181818164

We propose Feedback Enabled Cascaded Classification Models (FE-CCM), that jointly optimizes all the subtasks while requiring only a “black box” interface to the original classifier for each subtask. We use a two-layer cascade of classifiers, which are repeated instantiations of the original ones, with the output of the first layer fed into the second layer as input. Our training method involves a feedback step that allows later classifiers to provide earlier classifiers information about which error modes to focus on.

This paper presents a novel heuristic algorithm to solve DED problem of generating units by employing a hybrid immune-genetic algorithm. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, four test systems that consist of different numbers of generating units are studied. The valve-point effects, POZs, and ramp-rate constraints along with transmission losses are also considered in simulation cases.

Under optimized electrolyte conditions (0.04 mol L−1 Britton-Robinson buffer solution at pH 4.0) FRD was oxidized at + 1.10 V and both compounds were oxidized at + 1.30 V. The MPA detection involves the continuous application of two potential pulses as a function of time to determine FRD at the first potential and HCT at the second after subtracting the FRD current obtained at the second potential. A correction factor was needed because the current of FRD at both potentials was different. A boron-doped diamond working electrode was selected for the simultaneous determination as its surface is less susceptive to fouling. The compounds exhibited a linear response range of 2 to 100 μmol L−1 for HCT (r = 0.9990) and 2 to 300 μmol L−1 for FRD (r = 0.9993), satisfactory repeatability (RSD lower than 5% for n = 30), detection limits of 0.65 μmol L−1 for FRD and 0.63 μmol L−1 for HCT, and analytical frequency of 130 injections per hour. The proposed method was applied for the analysis of synthetic urine samples spiked with both compounds and proper recovery values were obtained (95–110%), confirming the potential application for anti-doping analyses. Moreover, the proposed method was compared to UV–Vis spectrophotometry for the analysis of pharmaceutical formulations and they were found to be statistically similar at the 95% confidence level.",7.0,2.333333333333333,False,"['-', '-', '-', '-', '-']","[None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None]",22,-1,5.60582875259501e-05,-1,1,0.02719452,0.5932211875915527,0.7255638241767883,0.6633427143096924,0.5167978405952454,0.4766019582748413,1.0,42.0,9.0,245.0,144,88.86178861788618,0.6578947368421053,0.2593984962406015,1.8909774436090223,15.799308270676704

Nevertheless, these scenarios demand IoT representations of all participating machines and components, which requires high installation efforts and hardware adjustments. We propose an incremental process for bringing the shop floor closer to the IoT vision. Currently the majority of systems, components or parts are not yet connected with the internet and might not even provide the possibility to be technically equipped with sensors. However, those could be essential parts for a realistic digital shop floor representation. We therefore propose Virtual Representations, which are capable of independently calculating a physical object's condition by dynamically collecting and interpreting already available data through RESTful Web APIs.

 During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, different technologies, including telehealth, are maximised to mitigate the risks and consequences of the disease. Telehealth has been widely utilised because of its usability and safety in providing healthcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a systematic literature review which provides extensive evidence on the impact of COVID-19 through telehealth and which covers multiple directions in a large-scale research remains lacking. This study aims to review telehealth literature comprehensively since the pandemic started. It also aims to map the research landscape into a coherent taxonomy and characterise this emerging field in terms of motivations, open challenges and recommendations. Articles related to telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic were systematically searched in the WOS, IEEE, Science Direct, Springer and Scopus databases. The final set included (n=86) articles discussing telehealth applications with respect to (i) control (n=25), (ii) technology (n=14) and (iii) medical procedure (n=47). Since the beginning of the pandemic, telehealth has been presented in diverse cases. However, it still warrants further attention. Regardless of category, the articles focused on the challenges which hinder the maximisation of telehealth in such times and how to address them. With the rapid increase in the utilization of telehealth in different specialised hospitals and clinics, a potential framework which reflects the authors’ implications of the future application and opportunities of telehealth has been established. This article improves our understanding and reveals the full potential of telehealth during these difficult times and beyond.

Disruptions in neuronal function, proximal in time to blast exposure, may eventually contribute to the late emergence of clinical deficits. Using magic angle spinning 1H MRS and a rodent model of blast‐induced neurotrauma, we found acute (24–48 h) decreases in succinate, glutathione, glutamate, phosphorylethanolamine and γ‐aminobutyric acid, no change in N‐acetylaspartate and increased glycerophosphorylcholine, alterations consistent with mitochondrial distress, altered neurochemical transmission and increased membrane turnover. Increased levels of the apoptotic markers Bax and caspase‐3 suggested active cell death, consistent with increased FluoroJade B staining in the hippocampus. Elevated levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein suggested ongoing inflammation without diffuse axonal injury measured by no change in β‐amyloid precursor protein. In conclusion, blast‐induced neurotrauma induces a metabolic cascade associated with neuronal loss in the hippocampus in the acute period following exposure.

Edge computing will face the challenges of high bandwidth, low latency, high reliability and other requirements of 5G network services. Due to the limited resources of node communication, computing and storage, under the sudden, intensive and high-traffic task request, edge computing will suffer from network jitter, excessive delay, access congestion, service failure and low distribution efficiency. In order to ensure network service quality and improve service efficiency, it is necessary to construct an effective collaborative service mechanism, motivate nodes to participate in cooperation, integrate network service resources and self-adapt to manage collaborative services. Therefore, establishing an effective node and service evaluation system to identify reliable resources and nodes is an effective way to improve the overall availability and reliable services of edge computing network. In this paper, we summarize and analyze the key technologies of the current collaborative service organization incentive and trust mechanism. This paper presents an attack-resistant node and service evaluation system based on a trust network. The system includes a voting collection mechanism, a trustable node selection mechanism, a questioning response mechanism and a punishment mechanism. The experiments prove that the system has a strong ability to resist attacks and is superior to the existing reputation evaluation model in terms of its performance.

Largely consistent with Corr’s (2010a) proposal concerning the neuropsychological deficits associated with the psychoticism–psychopathy continuum, results confirmed that low BIS activity was associated with both primary and secondary psychopathy; whereas low FFFS activity was associated with only primary psychopathy. In relation to the BAS, reward sensitivity and drive were positively related to primary psychopathy; whereas Fun Seeking was negatively related to primary psychopathy but positively related to secondary psychopathy.

AI,"In the industry of the future, so as in healthcare and at home, robots will be a familiar presence. Since they will be working closely with human operators not always properly trained for human-machine interaction tasks, robots will need the ability of automatically adapting to changes in the task to be performed or to cope with variations in how the human partner completes the task. The goal of this work is to make a further step toward endowing robot with such capability. To this purpose, we focus on the identification of relevant time instants in an observed action, called dynamic instants, informative on the partner's movement timing, and marking instants where an action starts or ends, or changes to another action. The time instants are temporal locations where the motion can be ideally segmented, providing a set of primitives that can be used to build a temporal signature of the action and finally support the understanding of the dynamics and coordination in time. We validate our approach in two contexts, considering first a situation in which the human partner can perform multiple different activities, and then moving to settings where an action is already recognized and shows a certain degree of periodicity. In the two contexts we address different challenges. In the first one, working in batch on a dataset collecting videos of a variety of cooking activities, we investigate whether the action signature we compute could facilitate the understanding of which type of action is occurring in front of the observer, with tolerance to viewpoint changes. In the second context, we evaluate online on the robot iCub the capability of the action signature in providing hints to establish an actual temporal coordination during the interaction with human participants. In both cases, we show promising results that speak in favor of the potentiality of our approach.",11.0,2.75,False,"['M', 'F', 'F', 'F']","[None, None, None, 'MaLGa Machine Learning Genoa Center - Università degli Studi di Genova']","[None, None, None, 406]","[None, None, None, 65]",11,-1,7.086326620752597e-05,-1,-1,0.029262561,0.4849623739719391,0.5958266854286194,0.5471121668815613,0.4711086750030517,0.4050151705741882,1.0,27.0,10.0,306.0,159,89.0625,0.5324675324675324,0.237012987012987,1.8474025974025967,19.48574025974028

Here, we investigated electroencephalographic (EEG) signals in temporal and spectral domains in a continuous, circular arm movement task. Using machine learning methods that respect the linear mixture of brain activity within EEG signals, we show that directional information is represented in the temporal domain in amplitude modulations of the same frequency as the arm movement, and in the spectral domain in power modulations of the 20-24 Hz frequency band. In the temporal domain, the directional information was mainly expressed in primary sensorimotor cortex (SM1) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) contralateral to the moving arm, while in the spectral domain SM1 and PPC of both hemispheres predicted arm movement direction. The different cortical representations suggest distinct neural representations in both domains.

Over time, two unfortunate events have occurred with this tool acute complications have appeared, some potentially fatal, such as the EVALI (Electronic-cigarette or Vaping-Associated Lung Injury) epidemic in the USA, oral ingestion poisoning (accidental or intentional) , explosion injuries of the devices, and foreseeable chronic complications similar to those of conventional cigarettes such as bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It has also been shown that the use of E-cigarette in young people predisposes in the future to the use of conventional cigarettes. The other unfortunate fact is that the tool has been implemented to inhale other drugs, other than nicotine, such as marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and solvents for inhalation whose toxicity are not known or insufficiently investigated. This was predictable to happen. The neoplastic toxicity of this tool is also unknown. This monograph, intend to update and present in a concise manner the recent information on these complications and that readers find such information in a single monograph. The work not only covers clinical and chemical aspects of vaping but also some reflections on economic, ethical and legal aspects of it. *Correspondence to: Alcibey Alvarado.

 Background: Recently, drought stress has brought tremendous loss on the production of agriculture and animal husbandry. In realistic production, plants are often in cyclic wet-dry environment. Therefore, the factors that affect the final yield of plants in adversity including the resistance and tolerance to drought and the ability of plants to resume from the previous damage after rehydration. So it’s necessary for us to study the response and adaptive strategies of plants to drought and rehydration. Generally, the yield of herbage with strong resistance is relatively low. However, Medicago ruthenica(L.)cv.Zhilixing has the advantages of strong resistance and high yield concurrently. This made it can be used for raising livestock, natural grassland improvement, as a good parent for breeding and a new and high quality resource of stress resistance genes. Now, there are still many problems need to be solved when compared with other important legume forages. Therefore, we analyzed the changes of Medicago ruthenica(L.)cv.Zhilixing on transcription level under drought stress and rehydration, explored its phased response strategies.Results: We obtained 191 DEGs in drought stress, and the three treatments has 43 DEGs in common. Galactose metabolism, Starch and sucrose metabolism, Arginine and proline metabolism, TCA cycle, Photosynthesis-antenna proteins, were involved in the adaptation of Medicago ruthenica to 9 days of drought stress. The regulation of Arginine and proline metabolism, Cysteine and methionine metabolism, Photosynthesis-antenna proteins, Ascorbate and aldarate metabolism were conducive to the resistance of Medicago ruthenica to severe drought stress. The regulation of Starch and sucrose metabolism, Flavonoid biosynthesis, Valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation, Circadian rhythm-plant was beneficial to the post drought recovery of Medicago ruthenica.Conclusions: We preliminarily analyzed the adaptation mechanism of the plant under different drought and rehydration conditions. Medicago ruthenica(L.)cv.Zhilixing adopts different strategies to adapt to different degrees of drought stress and rehydration. The research discovered the genes that can be used as candidate genes to improve stress resistance and drought adaptability of plants. Our transcriptome data dramatically enriches the resources of stress resistance genes. It can provide theoretical support for further adaptation mechanism research of the plant under different drought and rehydration conditions.",4.0,1.3333333333333333,False,"['-', 'M', '-']","[None, None, None]","[None, None, None]","[None, None, None]",18,-1,6.229333966934692e-05,-1,1,0.034544893,0.6219528317451477,0.6370348930358887,0.4386065900325775,0.4966877102851867,0.4813719093799591,0.5,25.5,10.5,173.5,177,90.74344023323616,0.6418732782369146,0.3636363636363636,2.1019283746556474,6.986359504132253

Brown'}, {'authorId': '71939539', 'name': 'Kory D. Johnson'}]",,"The authors provide a novel and exciting framework for analyzing conditional selection. Formalizing the steps of a selection procedure as constraints on the response is applicable beyond the linear models theory discussed here and involves a high degree of technical accomplishment. It also raises interesting questions about different approaches to conditional inference. That being said, the usefulness of these tests appears limited in practice. For ease of exposition, we focus on the forward stepwise case, though the arguments are also applicable to LARS. The authors’ propose an “Exact Forward Stepwise” procedure (FS) that assigns new, “exact” p-values to the variables in a standard forward selection algorithm based on the usual ANOVA forward selection. At each stage, the algorithm includes the variable which creates the largest reduction in error sum of squares. After a variable is added, it is assigned a “p-value” by this “exact” procedure. This is a numerical quantity that has a U(0,1) distribution conditional on the sign of the selected variable and the variables that have been previously chosen. This extends conditional inference ideas and calculations from other recent papers so as to provide p-values for feature selection algorithms. As these algorithms are commonly used to build multiple regression models, one might think that improved p-values would lead to improved model selection, at least in some circumstances; however, the formulation in this paper involves a serious paradox. One needs to begin with a well-specified model selection algorithm and construct a model independent of the exact p-values described in the paper. The exact p-values can be constructed only after the model has been chosen; they cannot validly be used to select the model. If one tries to use them in this way, they become invalid. While forward stepwise and LARS operate independently of these p-values, one would expect the modeler to want to use the p-values to determine the step at which to “stop” the procedure and provide a final model. Consider the authors’ Table 1 (recreated below), which compares their FS p-values to naive forward stepwise p-values. Identifying a final model using such a table requires considering multiple p-values from separate steps of the procedure. Therein lies the problem: the set of exact p-values cannot be used to make decisions, else they are invalid. Even using these p-values as input into a secondary FDR-controlling procedure as in G’Sell et al. (2015) is inappropriate. Only one exact p-value can validly be used, testing one step of a much larger procedure. It should be noted that the conventional p-values are single-step values. They do not correct for the multiple testing nature of a stepwise procedure. Later in this commentary we recommend modified versions of the p-value calculations that can be validly and directly used for stepwise selection. See procedures (c) and (b) defined below. The procedure ES, defined below, is built on conditional inference logic and could be used to replace FS. For reasons discussed below, however, we do not favor its use. The columns in Table 1 labeled “JASA” are taken directly from the authors’ Table 1. The column labeled “Seq. p-value” contains traditional 2-sided p-values we calculated from our version of the data. Further information on our computations is in the appendix. Note that our p-values are 2-sided, whereas those in the paper are 1-sided. While providing 1-sided p-values may aid numerical comparison to the FS exact p-values, we note that these are one-sided conditional on the sign of the observed effect. Therefore, they are in effect 2-sided p-values and should be compared to ordinary 2-sided p-values.

Image Commun.,"Abstract Early intervention and treatment are crucial for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, it is challenging to identify individuals with ASD at an early age, i.e. under 3 years old, due to the lack of an effective and objective identification method. The mainstream clinical diagnosis relies on long-term observation of children’s behaviors, which is time-consuming and expensive, and thus how to accurately and quickly distinguish children with ASD in early childhood has become a critical issue. In this paper, we propose an eye movement based model to identify children with ASD. Specifically, children are required to freely observe some images. At the same time, their eye movements are recorded to analyze. Both the observed image and eye movements are input into our model.

This observation motivates the following research question: Given the LSO optimization procedure, how much does the choice of the objective function influence the results and in what way? We address this question empirically in a broad graph clustering context, that is, when graphs are either given as such or are k-nearest-neighbor graphs generated from a given data set. We consider normalized cut, modularity, and infomap, as well as two new objective functions. We show that all these objectives have a resolution bias, that is, they tend to prefer either small or large clusters. When removing this bias, by forcing the objective to generate a given number of clusters, LSO achieves similar performance across the considered objective functions on benchmark networks with built-in community structure. These results indicate that the resolution bias is the most important difference between objective functions in graph clustering with LSO. Spectral clustering is an alternative to LSO, which has been used to optimize the popular normalized cut and modularity objectives. We show experimentally that LSO often achieves superior performance than spectral clustering on various benchmark, real-life, and k-nearest-neighbor graphs.

The aim of this study was to analyze the role of anemia on infarct evolution and outcome after acute stroke treatment. Methods 1158 patients from Bern and 321 from Los Angeles were included. Baseline data and 3 months outcome assessed with the modified Rankin Scale were recorded prospectively. Baseline DWI lesion volumes were measured in 345 patients and both baseline and final infarct volumes in 180 patients using CT or MRI. Multivariable and linear regression analysis were used to determine predictors of outcome and infarct growth. Results 712 patients underwent endovascular treatment and 446 intravenous thrombolysis. Lower hemoglobin at baseline, at 24h, and nadir until day 5 predicted poor outcome (OR 1.150–1.279) and higher mortality (OR 1.131–1.237) independently of treatment. Decrease of hemoglobin after hospital arrival, mainly induced by hemodilution, predicted poor outcome and had a linear association with final infarct volumes and the amount and velocity of infarct growth. Infarcts of patients with newly observed anemia were twice as large as infarcts with normal hemoglobin levels. Conclusion Anemia at hospital admission and any hemoglobin decrease during acute stroke treatment affect outcome negatively, probably by enlarging and accelerating infarct growth. Our results indicate that hemodilution has an adverse effect on penumbral evolution.

The generated 3D model is developed to be the main input for Medical imaging tasks, although the model can be exploited in other fields as well. The algorithm is decomposed into two phases. The first phase deals with the location and extraction of human face from its cluttered background, this process is to focus on the region of interest (ROI) and to lessen 
down the computational burden. Since the input 2D pair of images are in color form, a wise decision is made to exploit their RGB color map information such that the RGB matrix is transformed into a new mapping encapsulating the intensity values (Y), the Chromatic blue (Cb) and Chromatic red (Cr)(e.g.: RGB AŽYCbCr). The second phase is the core of this paper. In stereo vision knowledge of 
epipolar lines (ELs) is extremely important as they describe the geometric relationship between the world points and their projections on the imaging sensors. In other words, these ELs with the predetermined two epipoles will solve what is known as the correspondence problem in an efficient way and reduces the search from the original 2D plan into merely 1D vector. In fact, the ELs are 
prone to errors; therefore, they must be constructed with care. To eliminate this problem and to increase the precision we chose to start with an initial eight matched points to generate the Fundamental Matrix (FM), this is called the 8- Points Algorithm. The FM has a compact description of the camera parameters and it is a 3x3 matrix. The 8- Points are selected from applying Harris 
corner detector. Thus, the epipolar line function will be given by: EL=F*f(x,y), where f(x,y) holds the 
point coordinates in the form [x,y,1]T , the superscript ( T ) denotes matrix transpose. This indicates that the epipolar constraint can be established with no prior knowledge of the stereo parameters.

Glaucoma can remain asymptomatic until a severe stage, resulting in a high prevalence of undiagnosed glaucoma worldwide. Asia accounts for 60% of the world's total glaucoma cases. To our knowledge, no epidemiological studies have assessed ethnic differences in undiagnosed glaucoma among various Asian subgroups.


OBJECTIVE
To determine the prevalence of, risk factors for, and visual features of undiagnosed primary glaucoma in a multiethnic Asian population.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
The Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases Study is a population-based trial in which 3353 Chinese (2009-2011), 3280 Malays (2004-2006), and 3400 Indians (2007-2009) aged 40 to 80 years were invited for an eye examination, including visual field assessment, to establish glaucoma diagnosis. Participants with undiagnosed glaucoma (ie, answering no to whether they previously had been told by a physician that they had glaucoma, not using glaucoma medication, or not having undergone glaucoma surgery) were identified.


MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES
Prevalence of, risk factors for, and visual features of undiagnosed glaucoma.


RESULTS
Of 272 participants with primary glaucoma, 196 (72.1%) were previously undiagnosed. The overall prevalence of undiagnosed primary glaucoma was highest among Malays (2.65%; 95% CI, 2.10%-3.31%), followed by Chinese (1.51%; 95% CI, 1.13%-2.01%) and Indians (0.97%; 95% CI, 0.64%-1.43%). In multivariable analysis, variables associated with higher risk of undiagnosed glaucoma were younger age (odds ratio [OR], 1.04; 95% CI, 1.00-1.09; P = .04), Malay ethnicity (OR, 3.65; 95% CI, 1.31-10.13; P = .01), presence of primary open-angle glaucoma (OR, 3.82; 95% CI, 1.60-9.14; P = .003), absence of yearly eyeglass checks (OR, 9.29; 95% CI, 3.43-25.21; P < .001), and lack of cataract surgery (OR, 4.19; 95% CI, 1.68-10.48; P < .001). No patients were blind in both eyes. A mean (SD) of 4.1% (2.8%) (n = 8) of the newly diagnosed patients were blind in 1 eye, and a mean (SD) of 56.0% (7.2%) (n = 102) had noteworthy visual field damage (mean deviation worse than -6 dB) in at least 1 eye.


CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE

The candidate voxels are then tested stepwise for inclusion in a bagged tree ensemble. After the predictive model is constructed, bias correction is performed to further increase prediction accuracy.

Also, there is a huge diversity in production strategies and objectives among farming households as well as household individuals. Agriculture in Africa is mainly seasonal and faces high levels of risks, which are in-turn compounded by poor infrastructure and isolated rural communities [1].

The search terms were: attitudes, university students, organ donation and Latin America. Only articles published from 2010 onwards were included. Results: Of the 37 articles reviewed, 10 were excluded because they belonged to Asian, African and Oceania countries because they were sociocultural realities with a marked difference to Latin American (religion, culture, etc.). .). 
In addition, 5 articles were discarded because they focused on organizational factors of the donation, as well as on the results of educational programs and in different populations. Finally, 4 articles were discarded because they were older than 2000 and lack publication information. We considered 8 sources with a theoretical 
approach and 10 that showed research done in this social group (university). Conclusion: The socio-cultural factors influencing the attitude of university students are multiple and with different weight, but the most significant is the level of knowledge regarding the subject.

Estimating boundary ownerships is a key step in perceptual organization: it allows higher-level processing to be applied on non-accidental shapes corresponding to figural regions. Existing methods for estimating the boundary ownerships for a given set of boundary curves model the probability distribution function (PDF) of the binary figure/ground random variables associated with the curves. Instead of modeling this PDF directly, the proposed method uses the 2.1D model: it models the PDF of the ordinal depths of the image segments enclosed by the curves. After this PDF is maximized, the boundary ownership of a curve is determined according to the ordinal depths of the two image segments it abuts. This method has two advantages: first, boundary ownership configurations inconsistent with every depth ordering (and thus very likely to be incorrect) are eliminated from consideration; second, it allows for the integration of cues related to image segments (not necessarily adjacent) in addition to those related to the curves. The proposed method models the PDF as a conditional random field (CRF) conditioned on cues related to the curves, T-junctions, and image segments. The CRF is formulated using learnt non-parametric distributions of the cues. The method significantly improves the currently achieved figure/ ground assignment accuracy, with 20.7% fewer errors in the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset.",40.0,2.857142857142857,False,"['-', '-']","[None, 'Professor of Computer Science, The Technion']","[None, 1933]","[None, 115]",6,1,5.164354247624957e-05,-1,1,0.11584069,0.5660073757171631,0.7058480381965637,0.5834813714027405,0.4065779447555542,0.5311477780342102,1.0,36.0,9.0,224.0,125,88.91509433962264,0.6379310344827587,0.3189655172413793,1.9741379310344829,14.549431034482808

Aim: This study aims at designing and evaluating a faculty development programme on learning and teaching professionalism in the Arabian context. Programme development: The study used a participatory design, where four authors and 28 teachers shared the responsibility in programme design in three steps: orientation workshop for teachers, vignette development, and teaching professionalism to students. The workshop provided the cognitive base on the salient attributes of professionalism in the Arabian context. After the workshop, authors helped teachers to develop a total of 32 vignettes in various clinical aspects, portraying a blend of professionalism dilemmas. A battery of seven questions/triggers was suggested to guide students’ reflection. Programme evaluation: The programme was evaluated with regard to its “construct” and its “outcomes”. The programme has fulfilled the guiding principles for its design and it has emerged from a genuine professionalism framework from local scholarly studies in the Arabian context. Programme outcomes were evaluated at the four levels of Kirkpatrick’s model; reaction, learning, behaviour, and results. Discussion: The study communicates a number of context-specific issues that should be considered when teaching professionalism in Arabian culture with respect to teachers and students. Three lessons were learned from developing vignettes, as reported by the authors. This study advocates the significance of transforming faculty development from the training discourse of stand-alone interventions to mentorship paradigm of the communities of learning. Conclusion: A three-step approach (orientation workshop, vignettes development, and teaching professionalism) proved effective for faculty development for learning and teaching of professionalism.

To demonstrate the approach, we develop a physics-based, virtual marine world. The world is inhabited by artificial fishes that can swim hydrodynamically in simulated water through the motor control of internal muscles that motivates fins.

Process.,"Several current implementations of quantum circuits rely on the linear nearest neighbor restriction, which only allows interaction between adjacent qubits. Most methods that address the process of converting a generic circuit to an equivalent circuit which satisfies this restriction, minimize the number of additional SWAP gates required by this process. Moreover, most methods which address this problem are designed for 1D circuits. Considering the new and promising proposals for 2D quantum circuits, what we propose is a new perspective on this problem, namely that it can be seen as a multiobjective optimization problem. To test our hypothesis, we developed a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm that solves this problem by considering two objectives: minimizing the size of the 2D grid where the circuit is placed, and minimizing the number of additional SWAP gates. Of the methods designed for 2D circuits, only one considers different grid sizes which are much larger than strictly necessary. Consequently, our algorithm makes considerations which other methods do not make, since it naturally finds the grid which requires fewer SWAP gates for the circuit conversion, whether it is one-dimensional or two-dimensional. Our experimental results indicate that allowing a larger grid size results in fewer additional SWAP gates in about 73% of the tested circuits. Additionally, the average improvement we found when using larger grid sizes is about 30%, while the best improvement over using the smallest possible grid is 63.8%.",13.0,2.1666666666666665,False,"['-', '-']","[None, None]","[None, None]","[None, None]",11,-1,5.8291265661138624e-05,-1,1,0.031776704,0.4917177855968475,0.6753143072128296,0.3474138081073761,0.3879109621047973,0.280197262763977,1.0,28.0,9.0,232.0,127,92.16279069767442,0.6042553191489362,0.2297872340425532,1.9319148936170207,17.208000000000055

It has been reported that stress is an important risk factor for slower wound healing and susceptibility to infection. The purpose of this study was to objectively monitor physiological stress response in patients with diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) during a clinical visit for wound dressing change. Methods Physiological stress was continuously monitored in 20 patients (Age: 56.7 ± 12.2 years) with DFU for duration of approximately 45 min including waiting, dressing change and post-dressing period. Stress was quantified using a custom algorithm based on standard deviation of R-R intervals, heart rate variability (HRV). To identify the change in level of stress, change in HRV was compared to baseline HRV. Medium and high-stress periods were defined when HRV was in the range of 60–85% and below 60% of baseline HRV, respectively. Results During the entire time of visit medium and high stress episodes happened for 28 ± 12.6% and 16 ± 18% of the time respectively. Further analyses of wound dressing time revealed that medium and high stress episodes were experienced for 47 ± 24% and 18.3 ± 27% of dressing time respectively. In addition, the duration of medium stress was significantly increased in average by 66% (difference = 21.8%, p = 0.002, 95%CI [7.5, 29.5]%) during dressing change compared to entire period of clinic visit. Conclusions This pilot study shows that patients with DFU experience moderate to high stress while visiting a wound clinic, which may negatively impact wound healing outcomes. In particular, the highest stressful condition was during wound dressing change, which may be related to painful dressing or perception of pain. Further investigation is required to explore association between quantified stress and outcomes of wound healing. In addition, future studies need to explore benefit of stress management in enhancing the outcomes of wound healing in patients with diabetes.",21.0,2.333333333333333,False,"['-', '-', 'F', '-', '-', '-', 'F', 'M']","[None, 'Abbott Labs', None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, 254, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, 34, None, None, None, None, None, None]",14,-1,5.124166983392017e-05,-1,1,0.070414715,0.4473718404769897,0.6867637634277344,0.3372940123081207,0.4435980916023254,0.4107232093811035,1.0,49.0,17.0,313.0,165,93.12292358803988,0.6666666666666666,0.2242990654205607,1.83177570093458,29.13077570093461

We present a system which is able to automate the extraction of many kinematic parameters such as stroke frequency, kick rates and stroke-specific intra-cyclic parameters from video footage of an athlete. While this task can in principle be solved by human pose estimation, the problem is exacerbated by permanently changing self-occlusion and severe noise caused by air bubbles, splashes, light reflection and light refraction. Current approaches for pose estimation are unable to provide the necessary localization precision under these conditions in order to enable accurate estimates of all desired kinematic parameters. In this paper we reduce the problem of kinematic parameter derivation to detecting key frames with a deep neural network human pose estimator. We show that we can correctly detect key frames with a precision which is on par with the human annotation performance. From the correctly located key frames, aforementioned parameters can be successfully inferred. Motivation In this paper, we consider a real-world computer vision application that assists a competitive athlete in assessing and improving his or her performance by taking advantage of the proposed pose estimation system. In the field of competitive swimming a quantitative evaluation of kinematic parameters is both a valuable tool for trainers as well as a labor intensive task. The training scenario is limited to a competitive swimmer swimming in a special pool: a swimming channel (see Figure 1). The water in this pool can be artificially accelerated to constantly flow from one end of the pool to the other. The swimmer performs regular swimming motions while being filmed through a glass wall by a single camera. After the training session, the video footage is evaluated by trainers and athletes. A qualitative evaluation is usually supplemented by a quantitative analysis, where the video footage is assessed and annotated frame by frame to extract points of interest like joint positions, body part angles relative to the image plane, and other variables of interest. From theses annotations, kinematic parameters can easily be derived and used for rating the efficiency of an athlete’s swimming style and giving recommendations for pose adjustments, which finally can lead to a significant performance improvement. The whole task of manually performing a quantitative analyses is extremely time consuming and therefore performed only for very few athletes nowadays. We present a system which is able to automate the extraction of many kinematic parameters such as stroke frequency, kick rates and stroke-specific intra-cyclic parameters from video footage of an athlete.

However, since the measured data events are not labelled (i.e., we do not know in advance what fingerprint in the measured data corresponds to a future fibre break), unsupervised machine learning methods must be used. Here, we report a proof-of-concept approach in which we use a simple polarimetric technique and installed optical fibre, which we disturb with controlled vibrations, knocking on the fibre, and rack door closing near the fibre. Using a machine learning K-means algorithm, we distinguish between data generated with these controlled disturbances and data generated by noise due to common traffic. These results are the first step along the way to automated data labelling, which can be used for the classification of events.",1.0,0.3333333333333333,False,"['M', 'M', '-', 'M']","['ČVUT, CESNET', None, None, None]","[108, None, None, None]","[24, None, None, None]",11,-1,7.874486427310225e-05,-1,-1,0.06933902,0.7038190364837646,0.5747513771057129,0.5815941691398621,0.4432313740253448,0.5259697437286377,1.0,30.0,8.0,200.0,123,91.7379679144385,0.6086956521739131,0.2318840579710145,1.8985507246376807,20.84260869565219

McClelland (mcclelland@stanford.edu) Department of Psychology Surya Ganguli (sganguli@stanford.edu) Department of Applied Physics Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305 USA Abstract Psychological experiments have revealed remarkable regulari- ties in the developmental time course of cognition. Infants gen- erally acquire broad categorical distinctions (i.e., plant/animal) before finer ones (i.e., bird/fish), and periods of little change are often punctuated by stage-like transitions. This pattern of progressive differentiation has also been seen in neural net- work models as they learn from exposure to training data. Our work explains why the networks exhibit these phenomena. We find solutions to the dynamics of error-correcting learning in linear three layer neural networks. These solutions link the statistics of the training set and the dynamics of learning in the network, and characterize formally how learning leads to the emergence of structured representations for arbitrary training environments. We then consider training a neural network on data generated by a hierarchically structured probabilistic gen- erative process. Our results reveal that, for a broad class of such structures, the learning dynamics must exhibit progres- sive, coarse-to-fine differentiation with stage-like transitions punctuating longer dormant periods. Keywords: neural networks; hierarchical generative models; semantic cognition; learning dynamics Introduction Our world is characterized by a rich, nested hierarchical structure of categories within categories, and one of the most remarkable aspects of human semantic development is our ability to learn and exploit this structure. Experimental work has shown that infants and children acquire broad categorical distinctions before fine categorical distinctions (Keil, 1979; Mandler & McDonough, 1993), suggesting that human cat- egory learning is marked by a progressive differentiation of concepts from broad to fine. Furthermore, humans can ex- hibit stage-like transitions as they learn, rapidly progress- ing through successive levels of mastery (Inhelder & Piaget, 1958; Siegler, 1976). Many neural network simulations have captured aspects of these broad patterns of semantic development (Rogers & Mc- Clelland, 2004; Rumelhart & Todd, 1993; McClelland, 1995; Plunkett & Sinha, 1992; Quinn & Johnson, 1997). The inter- nal representations of such networks exhibit both progressive differentiation and stage-like transitions. However, the the- oretical basis for the ability of neuronal networks to exhibit such strikingly rich nonlinear behavior remains elusive. What are the essential principles that underly such behavior? What aspects of statistical structure in the input are responsible for driving such dynamics? For example, must networks exploit nonlinearities in their input-output map to detect higher order statistical regularities to drive such learning? W 32 y ∈ R N 3 h ∈ R N 2 W 21 x ∈ R N 1 Figure 1: The three layer network analyzed in this work. Here we analyze the learning dynamics of a linear three layer network and find, surprisingly, that it can exhibit highly nonlinear learning dynamics, including rapid stage-like tran- sitions. Furthermore, when exposed to hierarchically struc- tured data sampled from a hierarchical probabilistic model, the network exhibits progressive differentiation of concepts from broad to fine. Since such linear networks are sensitive only to the second order statistics of inputs and outputs, this yields the intriguing result that merely second order patterns of covariation in hierarchically structured data contain statis- tical signals powerful enough to drive certain nontrivial, high level aspects of semantic development in deep networks. We outline our approach here in brief. We begin by de- composing the training set to identify important dimensions of variation using the singular value decomposition (SVD), which will turn out to be fundamental to our analysis. Next, we examine the equations governing gradient descent learn- ing and show that they can be solved in terms of the SVD of the training set. This solution analytically expresses the weight values of the neural network at any point in time dur- ing learning as a function of the input training set. Finally, we consider generating the training set from a hierarchical prob- abilistic generative model. We analytically calculate the SVD of training sets so generated, which in combination with our previous results gives a formal grounding for how neural net- works will learn about hierarchical categorical structure. We show that networks must exhibit progressive differentiation of categorical structure and stage-like transitions for any train- ing set generated by a class of hierarchical generative models. Decomposing the training set Our fundamental goal is to understand the dynamics of learn- ing in neural networks as a function of the training set.

Moreover, the proposed method increases the security of the stored biometric templates. As a case study, the proposed framework is employed for the development of a novel gait recognition system based on the extraction of depth data from human silhouettes and a set of discriminative features. Specifically, gait sequences are represented using the radial and the circular integration transforms and features based on weighted Krawtchouk moments.

Despite progress identifying risk factors, limited research has examined how to combine variables into an optimized post-earthquake PTSD prediction tool that could be used to triage survivors to mental health services. The current study developed a post-earthquake PTSD risk score using machine learning methods designed to optimize prediction. The data were from a two-wave survey of Chileans exposed to the 8.8 magnitude earthquake that occurred in February 2010. Respondents (n = 23,907) were interviewed roughly three months prior to and again three months after the earthquake. Probable post-earthquake PTSD was assessed using the Davidson Trauma Scale. We applied super learning, an ensembling machine learning method, to develop the PTSD risk score from 67 risk factors that could be assessed within one week of earthquake occurrence. The super learner algorithm had better cross-validated performance than the 39 individual algorithms from which it was developed, including conventional logistic regression. The super learner also had a better area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.79) than existing post-disaster PTSD risk tools. Individuals in the top 5%, 10%, and 20% of the predicted risk distribution accounted for 17.5%, 32.2%, and 51.4% of all probable cases of PTSD, respectively.

This is mainly due to the fact that speech technologies have considerably improved during the last years, and nowadays more and more people make use of them, ever more naturally. Literature shows that two major points of interest are involved in the use of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in CALL: Computer-assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) and Spoken Grammar Practise (SGP). In a CAPT typical application, the user is required to read and record a sentence, and send it to the learning application server. It returns a result, generally using a three-level colour system indicating which phone has been correctly pronounced and which has not. SGP applications are not very popular yet, but some examples are multiple-choice tests, where users orally choose an answer between several choices, or even the Intelligent Language Tutoring Systems, where learners respond to cues given by the computer and the system provides feedback. Such tools can be used to strengthen the students’ autonomy on their learning process, giving the opportunity of using voice to improve their pronunciation or to do grammar exercises outside the classroom. In this work, two applications have been considered: on the one hand, a classical CAPT system, where the student records a predefined sentence and the system gives a feedback about the pronunciation; on the other hand, a novel Word-by-Word Sentence Verification (WWSV) system, where a sentence is verified sequentially, word by word, and as soon as a word is detected it is displayed to the user. The WWSV tool gives the option of creating a tool to solve grammar exercises orally (SGP). Both systems rely on utterance verification techniques, as the popular Goodness-of-pronunciation (GOP) score. The acoustic database chosen to train the systems is the Basque Speecon-like database, the only one publicly available for Basque, specifically designed for speech recognition and recorded through microphone. This database presents several drawbacks, such as the lack of a pronunciation lexicon and some annotation files. Furthermore, it contains much dialectal speech, mainly in the free spontaneous part. In ASR, phonetic variations can be modelled using a single acoustic model. However, CAPT systems require ""clean"" models to use as reference. Thus, some work had to be carried out on the annotation files of the database. A number of transcriptions have been changed and a new lexicon has been created considering different dialectal alternatives. It is noticeable that the new lexicon contains in average 4.12 different pronunciations per word. The speech recognition software used in this thesis is AhoSR. It has been created and developed by the Aholab research group, and it has been designed to cope with different recognitions tasks. In this thesis, utterance verification techniques have been implemented to be run together with the basic tasks. To do so, a parallel graph has been implemented to obtain GOP scores. For CAPT and WWSV tasks, specific search graphs have been added, in order to adapt to the needs of each of them. In addition, sockets have been implemented in the audio-input module of AhoSR. This allows real time performing when accessing the recogniser through the internet, and so it gives us the opportunity for AhoSR to be installed on a server, with universal access. Different ways to train Hidden Markov Models (HMM) have been analysed in depth. Initially, HMMs of better quality were expected by means of using the new dictionary with alternatives. However, results do not show this, probably because of the big amount of alternative pronunciations. The addition of some manually corrected data (15 % of the training set) allows obtaining similar results to those obtained using a single-entry dictionary. In order to take advantage of the manually corrected transcriptions, different ways of training HMMs have been analysed. Thus, we have found that slightly better HMMs are achieved using data with few transcription errors in the initial stages of the training and then using the whole database. To build the initial system, two GOP distributions were considered necessary to classify each phone: the distribution of the correctly pronounced phones and the distribution of the incorrectly pronounced ones. The GOPs of the incorrectly pronounced phones were obtained simulating errors and obtaining the GOP scores by forced alignment in the AhoSR decoder. Thus, the thresholds between correctly and incorrectly uttered phones were calculated as the Equal Error Rate (EER) point of both distributions. This approach was implemented in an initial prototype, and several laboratory experiments were performed which produced very good results. Then, the system was tested in more realistic environments: Basque language schools, among 20 students. The objective results along with the survey filled in by the 20 students who tested the system were really promising. The initial prototype was executed locally, and we felt the need of developing a more universal system in order to be accessed from any device and anywhere. Thus, we took advantage of the specifications of the recent HTML5 standard, which let the browser access the audio input, regardless of the platform, by means of the audio API. This has given us the opportunity to create a system accessible from any operative system. Moreover, for the WWSV-based SGP task, another API of HTML5 has been used (the web API ), which creates socket-like connections between the browser and the server, in order to send audio data on the fly. Several drawbacks have been managed for the on-line implementation of the system: for example, due to the different devices that users will use to pick up audio, some kind of parameter normalisation is needed. Furthermore, an on-line normalisation technique is necessary, since in WWSV continuous feedback must be provided before the whole signal has arrived to the recogniser. Different techniques have been tested to implement Cepstral Mean and Variance Normalisation (CMVN) and estimate the initial values of cepstral means and variances. The best results have been obtained by a hybrid approach proposed in this work, so that the initial means are estimated using the first N frames, and initial variances are obtained from the training datasets. In addition, a new CMVN technique has been devised in this thesis: the MultiNormalisation Scoring (MNS) based CMVN. MNS consists in generating multiple observation likelihood scores by normalising the incoming Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) using means and variances computed from different speech datasets recorded under different conditions. The MNS-based CMVN consists in computing the probabilities of a frame to belong to different training datasets; thus, these probabilities can be used as weights to calculate an estimation of the actual means and variances. The results obtained are remarkable, mainly for clean signals. The greatest advantage of using MNS is that the CMVN can perform on-line, frame by frame, with no need to analyse the neighbouring frames or the frames of a segment to which it belongs. Using the same MSN method, a novel and effective on-line Voice Activity Detector (VAD) has been devised as well. In a validation experiment, comparing the results of our MNS-based VAD with the results of two ITU-T VAD algorithms (G.720.1 and G.729b), we have obtained better overall results, since the classification errors are considerably lower for non-speech frames, and are comparable for speech frames. This makes our system useful for systems that require low speech error rates and also for low non-speech error rates. Finally, Neural Networks have been used in an attempt to see the impact of different parameters at the time of training a classifier. As a consequence, we have seen that GOP scores are the most efficient parameters among durations and log-likelihoods of the previous, current and posterior phones. The results of the experiments are coherent with those obtained in the initial system.",10.0,2.5,False,['-'],[None],[None],[None],16,-1,5.967352070123184e-05,-1,1,0.042066135,0.634729266166687,0.8169103860855103,0.6719413995742798,0.7878260612487793,0.501567542552948,1.0,195.0,57.0,1279.0,502,89.78243978243978,0.5791889824024483,0.234123947972456,1.8530986993114005,26.92085003825557

Accordingly, we investigated whether myocardial NOX2 overexpression in mice (NOX2-Tg) is sufficient to generate a favourable substrate for AF and further assessed the effects of atorvastatin, an inhibitor of NOX2, on atrial superoxide production and AF susceptibility. Methods and results NOX2-Tg mice showed a 2- to 2.5-fold higher atrial protein content of NOX2 compared with wild-type (WT) controls, which was associated with a significant (twofold) increase in NADPH-stimulated superoxide production (2-hydroxyethidium by HPLC) in left and right atrial tissue homogenates (P = 0.004 and P = 0.019, respectively). AF susceptibility assessed in vivo by transoesophageal atrial burst stimulation was modestly increased in NOX2-Tg compared with WT (probability of AF induction: 88% vs. 69%, respectively; P = 0.037), in the absence of significant alterations in AF duration, surface ECG parameters, and LV mass or function. Mechanistic studies did not support a role for NOX2 in promoting electrical or structural remodelling, as high-resolution optical mapping of atrial tissues showed no differences in action potential duration and conduction velocity between genotypes. In addition, we did not observe any genotype difference in markers of fibrosis and inflammation, including atrial collagen content and Col1a1, Il-1β, Il-6, and Mcp-1 mRNA. Similarly, NOX2 overexpression did not have consistent effects on RyR2 Ca2+ leak nor did it affect PKA or CaMKII-mediated RyR2 phosphorylation. Finally, treatment with atorvastatin significantly inhibited atrial superoxide production in NOX2-Tg but had no effect on AF induction in either genotype. Conclusion Together, these data indicate that while atrial NOX2 overexpression may contribute to atrial arrhythmogenesis, NOX2-derived superoxide production does not affect the electrical and structural properties of the atrial myocardium.",3.0,1.5,False,"['-', 'F', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', '-', 'M', '-', '-', 'F']","[None, None, None, None, 'Oxford university', None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, 605, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, 35, None, None, None, None, None, None]",16,1,5.990706226605882e-05,-1,1,0.038779385,0.676727831363678,0.6828996539115906,0.7338322997093201,0.7784210443496704,0.6689131259918213,1.0,67.0,11.0,312.0,187,93.21543408360128,0.6918429003021148,0.3172205438066465,2.117824773413897,-4.00097583081569

Comput.,"Currently, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are providing practical solutions for various applications, including smart agriculture and healthcare, and have provided essential support by wirelessly connecting the numerous nodes or sensors that function in sensing systems needed for transmission to backends via multiple hops for data analysis. One key limitation of these sensors is the self-contained energy provided by the embedded battery due to their (tiny) size, (in) accessibility, and (low) cost constraints. Therefore, a key challenge is to efficiently control the energy consumption of the sensors, or in other words, to prolong the overall network lifetime of a large-scale sensor farm. Studies have worked toward optimizing energy in communication, and one promising approach focuses on clustering. In this approach, a cluster of sensors is formed, and its representatives, namely, a cluster head (CH) and cluster members (CMs), with the latter transmitting the sensing data within a short range to the CH. The CH then aggregates the data and forwards it to the base station (BS) using a multihop method. However, maintaining equal clustering regardless of key parameters such as distance and density potentially results in a shortened network lifetime. Thus, this study investigates the application of fuzzy logic (FL) to determine various parameters and membership functions and thereby obtain appropriate clustering criteria. We propose an FL-based clustering architecture consisting of four stages: competition radius (CR) determination, CH election, CM joining, and determination of selection criteria for the next CH (relaying). A performance analysis was conducted against state-of-the-art distributed clustering protocols, i.e., the multiobjective optimization fuzzy clustering algorithm (MOFCA), energy-efficient unequal clustering (EEUC), distributed unequal clustering using FL (DUCF), and the energy-aware unequal clustering fuzzy (EAUCF) scheme. The proposed method displayed promising performance in terms of network lifetime and energy usage.",1.0,0.3333333333333333,False,"['-', '-', '-', '-']","[None, None, None, 'FPT University, Da Nang, Vietnam']","[None, None, None, 295]","[None, None, None, 18]",12,-1,6.553815667339149e-05,-1,-1,0.025705263,0.6107925772666931,0.6813884973526001,0.6248835325241089,0.6043604612350464,0.6017353534698486,1.0,72.0,11.0,290.0,182,91.4695340501792,0.6822742474916388,0.3411371237458194,2.080267558528428,4.048364548495016

The bond strength was evaluated in shear mode by using a Universal testing machine. Methods: The study was done using 120 extracted human molars. A low speed diamond disk saw with water coolant was used to slice off the occlusal 2mm of the samples whereby a flat dentinal surface surrounded by a thin rim of enamel was obtained. This section of tooth, was embedded in a self cure acrylic resin. A smear layer was created on the sectioned teeth using a 320 grit silicon carbide paper attached to the Handimet grinder (Buehler,Ltd) under water irrigation for a time period of 15 seconds. The dentin disks with the smear layer were then randomly divided into 2 groups namely Group I-without EDTA and Group II-with EDTA. Each of the Group was further divided into four Subgroups namely Sodium hypochlorite, Morinda citrifolia, Triphala and Chlorhexidine respectively. The dentin discs were then air dried using a air-water syringe. A brass tube was placed onto the dentin surface and was filled with the sealer RealSeal SE, which was mixed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The sealer was then light cured for 40 seconds and then allowed to set for 45minutes. The samples were then immediately stored in a closed container containing distilled water at 37 o C and maintained at 100% humidity for 7 days. Each specimen was evaluated for its shear bond strength value at a cross head speed of 1mm/minute. The shear force required to separate the cylinder from dentin for each specimen was recorded in Newtons (N), then divided by the contact surface area to determine the shear bond strength in Megapascals. Results: The results revealed that Subgroup Sodium hypochlorite had the highest shear bond strength in Group I and Group II followed in order by Subgroups Morinda citrifolia, Triphala and Chlorhexidine in both groups.

TGF‐β1 is often overexpressed in late stages of colorectal carcinogenesis and promotes tumour growth and metastasis. Several reports have verified that the loss of functional TGFBRII expression contributed to escape the tumour suppressor activity of TGF‐β1 and that the epithelial‐to‐mesenchymal transition (EMT) responded to TGF‐β1 involved in tumour invasion and metastasis. However, the mechanisms by which TGF‐β1 confers a growth advantage to TGFBRII‐null colorectal cancer cells have not been elucidated. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post‐transcriptional inhibitory regulators of gene expression that act by directly binding complementary mRNA and are key determinants of cancer initiation and progression. In this study, we revealed a role for miR‐200b in colorectal cancer. MiR‐200b was highly expressed in TGFBRII‐null tumour tissues and colorectal cancer cell lines and positively correlated with cell proliferation in tumour tissues and cell lines. In contrast, decreasing the miR‐200b level in TGFBRII‐null cells suppressed cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. Furthermore, in vivo studies also suggested a stimulating effect of miR‐200b on TGFBRII‐null cell‐derived xenografts. CDKN1B (p27/kip1) and RND3 (RhoE) have miR‐200b binding sequences within their 3′ untranslated regions and were confirmed to be direct targets of miR‐200b using fluorescent reporter assays. Meanwhile, CDKN1B (p27/kip1) played a role in miR‐200b‐stimulated TGFBR‐null CRC. This study suggests that miR‐200b plays a tumour‐promoting role by targeting CDKN1B (p27/kip1) in CRCs. J. Cell.

Tumor classification, however, is a typical small sample problem. In this paper, an inverse projection group sparse representation (IPGSR) model is presented for tumor classification based on constructing a low rank variation dictionary (LRVD), for short, LRVD-IPGSR model. Firstly, an IPGSR model is constructed based on making full use of existing training and test samples, and group sparsity effect of genetic data. Furthermore, from a new viewpoint, a LRVD is constructed for improving the performance of IPGSR-based tumor classification. The LRVD can be independently constructed by detecting and utilizing variations of normals and typical patients, rather than directly using and changed with the genetic data or their corresponding feature data. And the LRVD can be automatic updated and extended to fit the case of new types of diseases. Finally, the LRVD-IPGSR model is fully analyzed from feasibility, stability, optimization and convergence. The performance of the LRVD-IPGSR model-based tumor classification framework is verified on eight microarray gene expression datasets, which contain early diagnosis, tumor type recognition and postoperative metastasis.",19.0,6.333333333333333,False,"['-', '-', '-', 'F', '-', '-']","[None, None, None, None, None, 'Iwate Prefectural University']","[None, None, None, None, None, 9740]","[None, None, None, None, None, 555]",15,-1,6.037689081026473e-05,-1,-1,0.05899034,0.6953205466270447,0.566449761390686,0.4695191979408264,0.6297659873962402,0.470937043428421,1.0,35.0,9.0,187.0,111,91.04651162790698,0.6927083333333334,0.296875,2.03125,13.879250000000011

However, the vast majority of single-jaw transplant recipients demonstrate less-than-ideal skeletal and dental relationships, with suboptimal aesthetic harmony. The purpose of this study was to investigate reproducible cephalometric landmarks in a large-animal model, where refinement of computer-assisted planning, intraoperative navigational guidance, translational bone osteotomies, and comparative surgical techniques could be performed. Methods: Cephalometric landmarks that could be translated into the human craniomaxillofacial skeleton, and that would remain reliable following maxillofacial osteotomies with midfacial alloflap inset, were sought on six miniature swine. Le Fort I– and Le Fort III–based alloflaps were harvested in swine with osteotomies, and all alloflaps were either autoreplanted or transplanted. Cephalometric analyses were performed on lateral cephalograms preoperatively and postoperatively. Critical cephalometric data sets were identified with the assistance of surgical planning and virtual prediction software and evaluated for reliability and translational predictability. Results: Several pertinent landmarks and human analogues were identified, including pronasale, zygion, parietale, gonion, gnathion, lower incisor base, and alveolare. Parietale-pronasale-alveolare and parietale-pronasale–lower incisor base were found to be reliable correlates of sellion-nasion–A point angle and sellion-nasion–B point angle measurements in humans, respectively. Conclusions: There is a set of reliable cephalometric landmarks and measurement angles pertinent for use within a translational large-animal model. These craniomaxillofacial landmarks will enable development of novel navigational software technology, improve cutting guide designs, and facilitate exploration of new avenues for investigation and collaboration.",19.0,2.111111111111111,False,"['-', '-', '-', '-', '-', 'M', '-', '-', 'M', 'M', '-', '-', 'M', '-', 'M', 'M', 'M', '-']","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",24,-1,0.0004305570813246,-1,-1,0.04149381,0.5778993964195251,0.6732285618782043,0.5310248136520386,0.4988352358341217,0.4604349434375763,1.0,46.0,12.0,236.0,157,91.35775862068964,0.7142857142857143,0.4166666666666667,2.4801587301587302,-24.80892857142853

In contrast to the feature enhancement methods, NAT estimates the underlying “pseudo-clean” model parameters directly without relying on point estimates of the clean speech features as an intermediate step. The pseudo-clean model parameters learned with NAT are later used with vector Taylor series (VTS) model adaptation for decoding noisy utterances at test time.

In addition, high-throughput satellites (HTSs) that allow high-speed and large-capacity communication are currently being launched. However, the allocation of communication resources to each beam is fixed in conventional HTSs, which exhibit low flexibility under state changes. This includes requests to the satellite communication systems or environmental changes around the systems. Therefore, the use of a digital channelizer in a satellite communication system can allocate frequency resources to each beam. However, even if a digital channelizer is used, conventional frequency resource allocation methods that consider inter-beam interference do not use the same frequency resource as the adjacent beam. As a result, the frequency resources cannot be used effectively. To alleviate this issue, we propose a frequency resource allocation method with inter-beam interference so that the satellite communication system can allocate frequency resources more flexibly. In addition, we extend the conventional flexibility analysis model such that it quantifies the flexibility more accurately. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated under state changes of the satellite communication system using the extended flexibility analysis model.",3.0,1.0,False,"['-', 'M', 'F']","[None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None]",14,-1,6.15676449618069e-05,-1,-1,0.095061794,0.6304030418395996,0.5074533820152283,0.4755086898803711,0.5739256739616394,0.3300194442272186,1.0,30.0,10.0,194.0,105,91.25,0.63,0.405,2.32,-9.127999999999956

One-way time delays between pairs were manipulated electronically in the range of 3 to 78 ms. We are interested in quantifying the envelope of time delay within which two individuals produce synchronous performances. The results indicate that there are distinct regimes of mutually coupled behavior, and that ‘natural time delay’—delay within the narrow range associated with travel times across spatial arrangements of groups and ensembles—supports the most stable performance. Conditions outside of this envelope, with time delays both below and above it, create characteristic interaction dynamics in the mutually coupled actions of the duo. Trials at extremely short delays (corresponding to unnaturally close proximity) had a tendency to accelerate from anticipation. Synchronization lagged at longer delays (larger than usual physical distances) and produced an increasingly severe deceleration and then deterioration of performed rhythms. The study has implications for music collaboration over the Internet and suggests that stable rhythmic performance can be achieved by ‘wired ensembles’ across distances of thousands of kilometers.",85.0,6.538461538461538,False,"['-', '-', 'M']","[None, 'Adobe Research', None]","[None, 35, None]","[None, 8, None]",9,-1,0.0037072528743862,-1,1,0.1179995,0.6781191825866699,0.7470880746841431,0.6260390877723694,0.8721635937690735,0.6065575480461121,1.0,18.0,9.0,200.0,138,94.94565217391305,0.6323529411764706,0.2941176470588235,2.088235294117647,7.637294117647087

Complex wavelet transform provides important phase information of the signal and it is almost shift-invariant.

It shows that the nature of the complex wavelet coefficients does not change at multiple levels. This property provides an opportunity to apply the same function for the signal represented at multiple levels. We have applied the soft-thresholding function for denoising and deblurring of 1D and 2D signals and shown that the result gets improved at multiple levels. We have proposed a complex wavelet based method for denoising of signals corrupted with signal dependent and signal independent noise as well as a restoration method for blurred signals corrupted with noise. The proposed method is adaptive as it uses a soft-threshold function based on the standard deviation, the absolute mean and the absolute median of wavelet coefficients. The proposed threshold is level dependent as well. The effectiveness of the complex wavelet based signal restoration method has been tested and it was found that the performance of the proposed method is better than that of other similar type of methods that uses real valued wavelets.

We combine satellite data products to provide a first and general overview
of the physical sea ice conditions along the drift of the international Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition and a comparison with previous years (2005–2006 to 2018–2019). We find that the MOSAiC drift was around 20 % faster than the climatological mean drift, as a consequence of large-scale low-pressure
anomalies prevailing around the Barents–Kara–Laptev sea region between
January and March. In winter (October–April), satellite observations show
that the sea ice in the vicinity of the Central Observatory (CO; 50 km
radius) was rather thin compared to the previous years along the same
trajectory. Unlike ice thickness, satellite-derived sea ice concentration,
lead frequency and snow thickness during winter months were close to the
long-term mean with little variability. With the onset of spring and
decreasing distance to the Fram Strait, variability in ice concentration and lead activity increased. In addition, the frequency and strength of deformation events (divergence, convergence and shear) were higher during summer than during winter. Overall, we find that sea ice conditions observed within 5 km distance of the CO are representative for the wider (50 and 100 km) surroundings. An exception is the ice thickness; here we find that sea ice within 50 km radius of the CO was thinner than sea ice within a 100 km radius by a small but consistent factor (4 %) for successive monthly averages. Moreover, satellite acquisitions indicate that the formation of large melt ponds began earlier on the MOSAiC floe than on neighbouring floes.

For low burden areas, disaggregation regression models have been developed to estimate risk at high spatial resolution from routine surveillance reports aggregated by administrative unit polygons. However, in areas with both routine surveillance data and prevalence surveys, models that make use of the spatial information from prevalence point-surveys have great potential. Using case studies in Indonesia, Senegal and Madagascar, we compare two methods for incorporating point-level, spatial information into disaggregation regression models. The first simply fits a Gaussian random field to prevalence point-surveys to create a new covariate.

To evaluate the Individual Severity Score (ISS) as a predictor of mortality in patients with acute renal failure (ARF) and to determine mortality associated factors.


METHODS
Clinical records of patients with de diagnosis of ARF at the Hospital Arzobispo Loayza (HAL) of Lima (Perú) between the years 1995 and 2000 revised. The optimal cut point for sensitivity and specificity of the ISS was assessed using ROC curve analysis.


RESULTS
128 clinical records of patients with ARF were revised. The mortality rate was 10,94 % (14/128). Patients who died were significatively older and showed more frequently hypotension, jaundice, need of mechanical ventilation and coma. The optimal cut point for the ISS was 0,74 (sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 100%). The area under the curve value was 0,91 (CI95 0,81-1,03).

In this review, we introduce multiscale analysis methods for and the applications to two types of intensive longitudinal biomedical signals, heart rate variability (HRV) and spontaneous physical activity (SPA) time series. It has been shown that these ILD have robust characteristics unique to various multiscale complex systems, and some parameters characterizing the multiscale complexity are in fact altered in pathological states, showing potential usability as a new type of ambient diagnostic and/or prognostic tools. For example, parameters characterizing increased intermittency of HRV are found to be potentially useful in detecting abnormality in the state of the autonomic nervous system, in particular the sympathetic hyperactivity, and intermittency parameters of SPA might also be useful in evaluating symptoms of psychiatric patients with depressive as well as manic episodes, all in the daily settings.

Here, we report the use of a multiparametric, automated screening assay that incorporates sublethal and lethal cellular injury responses to perform high-throughput analysis of a batch of commercial metal/metal oxide nanoparticles (NP) with the inclusion of a quantum dot (QD1). The responses chosen for tracking cellular injury through automated epifluorescence microscopy included ROS production, intracellular calcium flux, mitochondrial depolarization, and plasma membrane permeability. The z-score transformed high volume data set was used to construct heat maps for in vitro hazard ranking as well as showing the similarity patterns of NPs and response parameters through the use of self-organizing maps (SOM). Among the materials analyzed, QD1 and nano-ZnO showed the most prominent lethality, while Pt, Ag, SiO2, Al2O3, and Au triggered sublethal effects but without cytotoxicity. In order to compare the in vitro with the in vivo response outcomes in zebrafish embryos, NPs were used to assess their impact on mortality rate, hatching rate, cardiac rate, and morphological defects. While QDs, ZnO, and Ag induced morphological abnormalities or interfered in embryo hatching, Pt and Ag exerted inhibitory effects on cardiac rate. Ag toxicity in zebrafish differed from the in vitro results, which is congruent with this material's designation as extremely dangerous in the environment. Interestingly, while toxicity in the initially selected QD formulation was due to a solvent (toluene), supplementary testing of additional QDs selections yielded in vitro hazard profiling that reflect the release of chalcogenides. In conclusion, the use of a high-throughput screening, in silico data handling and zebrafish testing may constitute a paradigm for rapid and integrated ENM toxicological screening.",307.0,25.58333333333333,True,"['M', 'F', 'M', 'M', '-', '-', 'M', '-', 'M', 'M', 'M', '-', 'M', '-', 'M', '-']","[None, None, 'Pacific Northwest National Laboratory', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, 656, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, 48, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",21,-1,0.0011604196251799,-1,1,0.048066802,0.5643920302391052,0.6068524122238159,0.4066962003707886,0.4131802320480346,0.5088532567024231,1.0,51.0,10.0,296.0,180,92.04225352112675,0.6513157894736842,0.2861842105263157,2.046052631578948,3.694947368421055

Analyzing the sensitivity of these key indicators to the choice of multiple combinations of the 12 characteristics, to risk aversion, and to estimation sample size, we show that constrained policies are much less sensitive to these parameters than their unconstrained counterparts.

Reduction of the models is obtained through an asymptotic expansion method. This mathematical formalism leads to the construction of explicit relationships that are very convenient for quantitative inversion. An experimental validation of the inversion procedures is performed on calibrated carbon-epoxy laminates. A particular attention is dedicated in the second part of this work to the experimental analysis of the impact of the definition of the experimental thermal contrast and the sane (i.e., non-defective) area on the inverted parameters. The analysis is carried out through a comparison between two classical definitions of the thermal contrast and a new method, the DAC contrast, developed recently by our team. The impact of a hyper parameter of the inversion procedures (i.e., the Laplace variable) is also analyzed.

While some existing methods for multiresolution registration do consider the way the resolution (scale) affects the image, they often consider the image one scale at a time, using geometric properties within that scale. Others use multiscale information, usually to produce more robust results, but only to register same-magnification images (e.g., stereo). A scale trace is the set of values that a single pixel takes on as magnification decreases and the effective point specifications corresponding increases. As such, scale traces capture information across multiple scales. This paper presents a method that uses correlation of scale traces through multiresolution images to find correspondences between images of the same scene at differing magnifications. Because the method relies solely on the multiscale properties of the images themselves and not on spatial correspondence, it is less sensitive to discrete sampling of potential scale factors. Sample results demonstrate that the method is able to accurately identify both the relative position and relative magnification (scale) of the two images.",31.0,1.2916666666666667,False,"['-', '-']","[None, 'Professor of Computer Science, Brigham Young University']","[None, 440]","[None, 31]",7,-1,5.412183369044865e-05,-1,-1,0.07556521,0.6892268657684326,0.6086929440498352,0.4730367660522461,0.8140067458152771,0.461987555027008,0.0,24.0,8.0,195.0,114,91.44067796610167,0.6091370558375635,0.3096446700507614,2.1573604060913705,-0.4436903553299203

To build a robust speaker recognition system against noise, we employ a two-stage attention model and combine it with a TDNN model. In this framework, the attention mechanism is used in two aspects: embedding space and temporal space. The embedding attention model built in embedding space is to highlight the importance of each embedding element by weighting them using self attention. The frame attention model built in temporal space aims to find which frames are significant for speaker recognition. To evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, we use the TIMIT dataset and test our approach in the condition of five kinds of noise and different signal-noise-ratios (SNRs). In comparison with three strong baselines, CNN, TDNN and TDNN+attention, the experimental results show that the use of our approach outperforms them in different conditions.

With the maturity of these models, though, it has become (again) clear that a key issue that needs to be addressed is that of “what are the features”, namely, how should domain elements be represented in a way that learning algorithms can effectively use them. This work focuses on this stage – the problem of mapping domain elements into representations that are useful as inputs to a learning algorithm. The process of re-representing domain elements, in a way that takes into account what is known (or previously learned) about the domain and the problem, is necessary in order to facilitate learning in complex situations, when learning requires exploiting the structural and relational information within the domain elements. Indeed, researchers and practitioners spend a significant portion of their time on the problem of feature engineering and a significant amount of computing cycles goes into this stage in the process. This computation is typically left unreported in research papers, where the starting point is usually after features have already been extracted but, clearly, are significant in applications. Mapping domain elements into representations that can be processed by learning algorithms (e.g., feature vectors), that is, extracting the relevant substructures and properties of the domain elements – typically done today in ad-hoc ways – might be computationally expensive and should be studied as an integral part of the learning process. The benefits of this integration are numerous, one of them being the possibility for kernels directly over structured examples, as in [5]. We argue, following [4], that the process of converting a domain element into a feature based representation is best viewed as an inference process, and we formalize it this way. At the heart of our approach is a knowledge representation language – Feature Description Logic (FDL) – that we use in order to represent both domain elements and potentially expressive “types” of features – along with Feature Generation Functions (FGFs), a mechanism to convert domain elements, given the features, and re-represent them in a way that can be used by general purpose learning algorithms. FDL is a specific Description Logic (DL), a knowledge representation that has been found useful in describing sets of individuals, or concepts , by specifying constraints which all members of the set must obey, and in establishing taxonomies involving those sets. DLs strike a good balance between expressivity and tractability, achieved by a careful choice of the types of constraints allowed. This choice makes description logics less expressive than full First Order Logic but expressive enough to allow efficient inference in structured relational domains. Of particular use for us will be subsumption, a standard inference task in DLs. A description C is said to subsume a description D if and only if all the individuals described by D must also be described by C. Within the FDL framework, examples can be richly structured objects composed by many individuals with relations among them. As in [4], we view examples as concept graphs, where nodes represent individuals with primitive Functional Subsumption in Feature Description Logic 3 Text: Mohammed Atta met with an Iraqi intelligence agent in Prague in April 2001. before person name(“Mohammed Atta”) gender(male)",0.0,0.0,False,"['-', '-']","['Research Scientist, Facebook, Inc.', None]","[None, None]","[4, None]",6,-1,5.8978344129884647e-05,-1,1,0.117320836,0.4646531939506531,0.7513011693954468,0.5625457167625427,0.5583522915840149,0.4621852338314056,1.0,71.0,18.0,548.0,264,93.07765151515152,0.5638686131386861,0.2645985401459854,1.8795620437956204,15.141051094890544

Herein, a new strategy is reported to simultaneously improve breakdown strength and discharged energy density by a step-by-step, controllable dual crosslinking process, which constructs a strengthened interface as well as reduces molecular chains relaxation under elevated temperatures. Great breakdown strength and discharged energy density is achieved in the dual crosslinked network BT-BCB@DPAES nanocomposites at elevated temperatures when compared to noninterfacial-strengthened, BT/DPAES composites, i.e., an enhanced breakdown strength and a discharged energy density of 442 MV m-1 and 3.1 J cm-3 , increasing by 66% and 162%, and a stable cyclic performance over 10 000 cycles is demonstrated at 150 °C.

In contrast to its monocular counterpart, stereo vision features more images from another camera looking from different viewpoints and has the capability of generating depth information for scenes. In this paper, a novel Binocular Consistent Sparse learning based Tracker (BCST) is proposed. With the popular sparse learning framework, the new method greatly improves tracking performance via efficiently exploiting the appearance and depth information from the binocular configuration. Valuable prior appearance of tracking object obtained through the second camera is integrated into an augmented dictionary via the proposed crossover templates. The depth is integrated into the sparse learning framework in three aspects. First, an extra depth view is added to the color image-based visual features as an independent view. Then a special depth consistency constraint is designed in the objective function.

Neurosci.,"In the era facilitated by the Internet of Things, ubiquitous communications as well as cloud services, sensing means, and human-computer interfaces are becoming all-pervasive and online. This makes it more possible for us than ever before to study engineering problems, human activities, and social behaviors through machine learning analysis of the big data produced in the ubiquitous environment. Looking at the recent history and new trends, machine learning has made attractive progress in wide areas of applications, from natural language to nonverbal communication, from engineering application to humanities, arts, and social studies, and from the real world to cyber space. 
 
In 1997, Dietterich summarized the development of machine learning in four directions: ensembles of classifiers, methods for scaling up supervised learning algorithm, reinforcement learning, and learning of complex stochastic models [1]. Latterly, Duch addressed machine learning as the foundations of computational intelligence comprehensively [2]. Since the beginning of the 21st century, research in machine learning has made progress in all of the four directions and has become focused on new challenges in learning from big data that cover a variety of application areas. One barrier that needs to be broken through is how to avoid the “curse of dimensionality” and ensure the generalization ability in the learning process. Owing to the efforts such as work of Koller and Friedman on Probabilistic Graphical Models [3] and the Compressive Sensing (CS) theory [4], the tentative path has been lightened. As the forethought by Wang [5], “predicting” the changes based on generalization ability and “describing” the knowledge discovered from huge data will be the two major tasks of machine learning in the future. 
 
In today's society, machine learning has been in an extensive demand in the areas associated with human's psychology and behaviors, such as ubiquitous learning, e-commerce, online customer service, behavioral finance analysis, and government emergency management. We believe that machine learning could be the most promising, sometimes even the only, way to accomplish the complex computation on human psychology and behaviors in the ubiquitous environment. 
 
However, in doing so, the machine learning research needs to pay attention to the following new aspects which may be beyond the ability of computer science and technology and requires more novel interdisciplinary ideas and methods: (1) a systematic model such as the social neuroscience mechanism [6] which can describe the neural activities and dominant process of human psychology and behaviors and helps the machine to understand its globally structural features and therefore reduce the computational cost by learning from the limited samples of a big data set, (2) the comprehensive context awareness in physical, cyber, and psychosocial spaces, as well as the information fusion processing and computing ability, which has been called Cyber Psychosocial and Physical (CPP) Computation by Dai [7], and (3) smart learning that enables the machine to cope with both rational intelligence and emotional intelligence in the learning process. 
 
The aim of this special issue is to bring together researchers working in different areas for exchanging and sharing with each other their progress in the new tendency of modern learning theory and applications. We were very pleased to see various new research ideas and many innovative contributions in the submitted manuscripts, which cover a wide range of recent advances in learning theory, techniques, and applications.

Results showed that after being treated by EF the content of most beneficial materials on brandy quality such as tannins, total phenols, volatile phenols as well as esters was increased while the content of some harmful compounds (acetaldehyde, acetal, and higher alcohols) was decreased. The amounts of acetaldehyde and higher alcohols on treated sample were 7.1% and 10.5% lower than the control one, respectively. On the other hand, the content of tannins and total phenols in brandy treated for 180 days was significantly higher than the control sample.

Variables that increase female co-dominance are intensity of aggression, group cohesion, a clumped distribution of food, a similar diet for the sexes and sexual attraction (by one sex to the other, but not mutually). We explain that in these cases female co-dominance increases due to more interactions between the sexes (under certain conditions), and as a consequence of all factors that increase the development of the hierarchy ( i.e. a higher number of interactions, more interactions per sex, a higher intensity of aggression and a clearer spatial structure).

Images containing spatial expression patterns illuminate the roles of different genes during embryogenesis. In order to generate initial clues to regulatory interactions, biologists frequently need to know the set of genes expressed at the same time at specific locations in a developing embryo, as well as related research publications. However, text-based mining of image annotations and research articles cannot produce all relevant results, because the primary data are images that exist as graphical objects. We have developed a unique knowledge base (FlyExpress) to facilitate visual mining of images from Drosophila melanogaster embryogenesis. By clicking on specific locations in pictures of fly embryos from different stages of development and different visual projections, users can produce a list of genes and publications instantly. In FlyExpress, each queryable embryo picture is a heat-map that captures the expression patterns of more than 4500 genes and more than 2600 published articles. In addition, one can view spatial patterns for particular genes over time as well as find other genes with similar expression patterns at a given developmental stage. Therefore, FlyExpress is a unique tool for mining spatiotemporal expression patterns in a format readily accessible to the scientific community.

While disease prevalence is higher in men, women present with more severe diastolic dysfunction and worse survival. Until today, little is known about the cellular differences underlying sex-differences in clinical presentation. Methods: To define sex-differences at the protein level, we performed a proteomic analysis in cardiac tissue obtained during myectomy surgery to relieve left ventricular outflow tract obstruction of age-matched female and male HCM patients harboring a sarcomere mutation (n = 13 in both groups). Furthermore, these samples were compared to 8 non-failing controls. Women presented with more severe diastolic dysfunction. Results: Out of 2099 quantified proteins, direct comparison of male, and female HCM samples revealed only 46 significantly differentially expressed proteins. Increased levels of tubulin and heat shock proteins were observed in female compared to male HCM patients. Western blot analyses confirmed higher levels of tubulin in female HCM samples. In addition, proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism were significantly lower in female compared to male samples. Furthermore, we found lower levels of translational proteins specifically in male HCM samples. The disease-specificity of these changes were confirmed by a second analysis in which we compared female and male samples separately to non-failing control samples. Transcription factor analysis showed that sex hormone-dependent transcription factors may contribute to differential protein expression, but do not explain the majority of protein changes observed between male and female HCM samples. Conclusion: In conclusion, based on our proteomics analyses we propose that increased levels of tubulin partly underlie more severe diastolic dysfunction in women compared to men. Since heat shock proteins have cardioprotective effects, elevated levels of heat shock proteins in females may contribute to later disease onset in woman, while reduced protein turnover in men may lead to the accumulation of damaged proteins which in turn affects proper cellular function.",2.0,1.0,False,"['F', '-', '-', '-', 'M', '-', '-', 'F', '-', '-', '-']","[None, None, None, 'Amsterdam UMC', None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, 3168, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, 86, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",10,-1,0.0001298217009426,-1,1,0.08437501,0.3726579844951629,0.5384936332702637,0.5707702040672302,0.3783736228942871,0.4282175898551941,1.0,44.0,19.0,309.0,162,94.07407407407408,0.7034700315457413,0.3406940063091482,2.141955835962145,4.716536277602557

In this task, participants first learn the probability that different stimuli will be associated with reward and punishment. During a subsequent test phase in which novel combinations of stimuli are presented, participants’ sensitivity to reward is tested by measuring their tendency to select the stimuli that were most highly rewarded during training, and their sensitivity to punishment is tested by measuring their tendency to not select the stimuli that were most highly punished during training. Compared with distraction, rumination led depressed participants to be less sensitive to the probability that stimuli will be associated with punishment and relatively less sensitive to punishment than reward. Never-depressed participants and depressed participants who were distracted from rumination were as sensitive to reward as they were to punishment. The effects of rumination on sensitivity to punishment may be a mechanism by which rumination can lead to maladaptive consequences.",52.0,4.727272727272728,False,"['-', '-', '-']","[None, 'Professor, Brown University', None]","[None, 5857, None]","[None, 101, None]",19,-1,5.06447165319412e-05,-1,-1,0.1099424,0.4501886367797852,0.5348027944564819,0.5334606766700745,0.4088755846023559,0.4738840162754059,1.0,15.0,7.0,198.0,87,89.91666666666667,0.525,0.36,2.09,1.2965000000000373

Infection occurs when rust spores germinate on the leaf surface and subsequently, specialized infection structures called haustoria form inside host cells followed by sporulation. Small RNA and transcriptome sequencing during Pgt-wheat infection reveals that the Pgt RNA interference (RNAi) machinery has functionally diversified. A number of Pgt RNAi genes are strongly up-regulated during late infection compared to the start of infection. This coincides with the production of two distinct Pgt small RNA (sRNA) profiles. At the start of infection, Pgt induces predominantly 21 nt sRNAs with a 5’ uracil derived from genes. In contrast, during late infection Pgt induces 22 nt sRNAs with a 5’ adenine derived from repeats. Strikingly, over 85% of Pgt sRNAs are differentially expressed during infection, compared to only 4% of wheat sRNAs. Using chromatin conformation capture assay data (Hi-C), we define Pgt centromeres and show that sRNAs up-regulated during late infection are derived from those repeat-rich, gene-poor and transcriptionally silent centromeric regions. We conclude that the Pgt RNAi machinery is highly regulated, resulting in differential accumulation of sRNA types throughout the infection cycle. Such tight temporal control of the RNAi machinery has thus far not been observed in fungi and might ensure genome stability during sporulation in rust fungi. Importance The wheat stem rust disease caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt) is one of the most devastating crop diseases and of significant global interest. Despite the availability of genomic resources, we have limited insight into how Pgt is able to quickly and aggressively overcome plant resistance. In this work, we deliver the first-time characterization of how Pgt utilizes small RNAs (sRNAs) during infection. Our work uncovers fundamental characteristics of the stem rust RNAi machinery and the first characterization of rust centromeres. Future research can use this knowledge to optimize methods of host-induced gene silencing where small RNAs from the plant operate via the fungus’s own RNAi machinery to silence genes important for causing disease.",2.0,0.4,False,"['F', 'F', 'M', '-', 'M', '-', 'M', 'F', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-']","['Senior Research Scientist - CSIRO', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[711, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[21, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",21,-1,6.085040381870159e-05,-1,1,0.064099565,0.4165173470973969,0.6472247838973999,0.4534679353237152,0.4571346342563629,0.401606798171997,0.0,50.0,18.0,337.0,188,94.11042944785277,0.6820809248554913,0.3034682080924855,1.945086705202312,20.864164739884387

The framework is mainly composed of integrated planner, integrated controller, and decision module for DDDAMS. The integrated planner, which is designed in an agent-based simulation (ABS) environment, devises best control strategies for each function of (1) crowd detection (vision algorithm), (2) crowd tracking (filtering), and (3) UAV/UGV motion planning (graph search algorithm). The integrated controller then controls real UAVs/UGVs for surveillance tasks via (1) sensory data collection and processing, (2) control command generation based on strategies provided by the decision planner for crowd detection, tracking, and motion planning, and (3) control command transmission via radio to the real system. The decision module for DDDAMS enhances computational efficiency of the proposed framework via dynamic switching of fidelity of simulation and information gathering based on the proposed fidelity selection and assignment algorithms. In the experiment, the proposed framework (involving fast-running simulation as well as real-time simulation) is illustrated and demonstrated for a real system represented by hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) real-time simulation integrating real UAVs, simulated UGVs and crowd, and simulated environment (e.g. terrain). Finally, the preliminary results successfully demonstrate the benefit of the proposed dynamic fidelity switching concerning the crowd coverage percentage and computational resource usage (i.e. CPU usage) under cases with two different simulation fidelities.",64.0,6.4,False,"['-', 'M', '-', '-', 'M', 'M', '-']","[None, 'Walmart Labs, University of Arizona', None, None, 'University of California, Berkeley (PhD)', None, None]","[None, 10, None, None, 4, None, None]","[None, 5, None, None, 0, None, None]",15,-1,7.33986766813699e-05,-1,1,0.13862006,0.6892027854919434,0.642578661441803,0.3976830244064331,0.412906140089035,0.5659862756729126,1.0,61.0,8.0,231.0,122,89.82062780269058,0.7283950617283951,0.3580246913580246,2.065843621399177,2.731129629629663

Other useful properties, associated with the learning of the mapping represented by an arbitrary list of input/output pairs, are also examined. These properties reveal some of the characteristics of learning in ARTMAP when it is used as a tool in establishing an arbitrary mapping from a binary input space to a binary output space.

However, learning long-horizon tasks on real robot hardware can be intractable, and transferring a learned policy from simulation to reality is still extremely challenging. We present a novel approach to model-free reinforcement learning that can leverage existing sub-optimal solutions as an algorithmic prior during training and deployment. During training, our gated fusion approach enables the prior to guide the initial stages of exploration, increasing sample-efficiency and enabling learning from sparse long-horizon reward signals. Importantly, the policy can learn to improve beyond the performance of the sub-optimal prior since the prior’s influence is annealed gradually. During deployment, the policy’s uncertainty provides a reliable strategy for transferring a simulation-trained policy to the real world by falling back to the prior controller in uncertain states. We show the efficacy of our Multiplicative Controller Fusion approach on the task of robot navigation and demonstrate safe transfer from simulation to the real world without any fine-tuning.

Second, the algorithms are mostly first-order and of quadratic time-complexity, and finally, the features and weights need to be defined precisely. We propose an alternative approach which employs deep neural networks for end-to-end similarity metric learning. We contrast and compare different recurrent neural architectures (LSTM and GRU) for representing symbolic melodies as continuous vectors, and demonstrate how duplet and triplet loss functions can be employed to learn compact distributional representations of symbolic music in an induced melody space.

Medication treatment changes, like changes to dosage or to frequency of intake, that are not overseen by a physician are, by that, non-adherence to medication. Despite the consequences, including worsening health conditions or death, 50% of patients are estimated to not take medications as indicated. Current methods to identify non-adherence have major limitations. Direct observation may be intrusive or expensive, and indirect observation through patient surveys relies heavily on patients' memory and candor. Using social media data in these studies may address these limitations. Methods: We annotated 9,835 tweets mentioning medications and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to find mentions of medication treatment changes, regardless of whether the change was recommended by a physician. We used active and transfer learning from 12,972 reviews we annotated from WebMD to address the class imbalance of our Twitter corpus. To validate our CNN and explore future directions, we annotated 1,956 positive tweets as to whether they reflect non-adherence and categorized the reasons given. Results: Our CNN achieved state-of-the-art performance with 0.50 F1-score. The manual analysis of positive tweets revealed that non-adherence is evident in a subset with nine categories of reasons for non-adherence. Conclusion: We showed that social media users publicly discuss medication treatment changes and may explain their reasons including when it constitutes non-adherence.

A message updating event is then triggered that reports the location of garbage truck and the forecasted arrival time. In experiments conducted on case studies, the results showed that the mean accuracy of predicted arrival time by the proposed method is about 81.45 per cent.

Nevertheless, most of the existing GCN-based network embedding methods are proposed for unsigned networks. However, in the real world, some of the networks are signed, where the links are annotated with different polarities, e.g., positive vs. negative. Since negative links may have different properties from the positive ones and can also significantly affect the quality of network embedding.

Then SNEA utilizes the masked self-attentional layers to aggregate more important information from neighboring nodes to generate the node embeddings based on balance theory.

Soft Comput.,"Abstract The receiver operating characteristic convex hull (ROCCH) is a popular technique for analyzing the performance of classifiers, which is particularly effective for the tasks with unbalanced data distribution. Although maximization of ROCCH can be tackled as a bi-objective optimization problem, existing multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) encounter difficulties in obtaining an ROCCH, since ROCCH is always convex but the Pareto front obtained by MOEAs may be concave. To address the issue, in this paper, a dynamic reference point-based MOEA, namely DR-MOEA is proposed for maximizing ROCCH performance. Specifically, in DR-MOEA, a reference point-based sorting is suggested, where the solutions are sorted by their distances to the reference points instead of Pareto dominance. Hence an ROCCH rather than a Pareto front is expected to be obtained. In addition, a reference point adaptation strategy is also designed, with which the reference points are dynamically adjusted during the evolutionary process, and the performance of DR-MOEA is further enhanced. Empirical studies are conducted by comparing the proposed algorithm with several state-of-the-arts on different data sets. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of DR-MOEA over the comparison methods in solving the ROCCH maximization problem.",4.0,1.3333333333333333,False,"['-', '-', '-', '-']","[None, None, 'Anhui University', None]","[None, None, 2247, None]","[None, None, 33, None]",13,-1,6.895198229723693e-05,-1,-1,0.14156583,0.2722427546977997,0.399081826210022,0.3090083599090576,0.3717076778411865,0.302253782749176,1.0,35.0,9.0,188.0,115,92.43016759776536,0.628140703517588,0.3266331658291457,2.100502512562814,5.279987437185952

Unfortunately complex relations among miRNAs and mRNAs remain still unclear, although there is a substantial agreement on the fact that miRNA are regulator of the mRNA expression. The complete elucidation of such mechanisms may have a great impact in the elucidation of cancer development and progress. In particular the comprehension of the disruption of regulatory mechanisms related to diseases remains still an un-explored field. Such relations may effectively modelled as a bipartite (un)weighted graph as proposed recently. The use of such a theoretical framework may enable the development of computational approaches of analysis based on results of graph theory. Here we propose a novel method to integrate miRNA and mRNA data into a single comprehensive model able to extract meaningful information. Starting from miRNA information stored in databases and from expression data of both mRNA and miRNA we build a weighted bipartite graph, called association graph representing the relations among those molecules. Then we use this graph in a two fold way. Initially, we extract maximally weighted cliques that represent association among miRNA and mRNAs.

Here, we use genetic mouse models to demonstrate a role of RGS4 in the maintenance of chronic pain states in male and female mice. Using paradigms of peripheral inflammation and nerve injury, we show that the prevention of RGS4 action leads to recovery from mechanical and cold allodynia and increases the motivation for wheel running. Similarly, RGS4KO eliminates the duration of nocifensive behavior in the second phase of the formalin assay. Using the Complete Freud's Adjuvant (CFA) model of hindpaw inflammation we also demonstrate that downregulation of RGS4 in the adult ventral posterolateral thalamic nuclei promotes recovery from mechanical and cold allodynia. RNA sequencing analysis of thalamus (THL) from RGS4WT and RGS4KO mice points to many signal transduction modulators and transcription factors that are uniquely regulated in CFA-treated RGS4WT cohorts. Ingenuity pathway analysis suggests that several components of glutamatergic signaling are differentially affected by CFA treatment between RGS4WT and RGS4KO groups. Notably, Western blot analysis shows increased expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 in THL synaptosomes of RGS4KO mice at time points at which they recover from mechanical allodynia. Overall, our study provides information on a novel intracellular pathway that contributes to the maintenance of chronic pain states and points to RGS4 as a potential therapeutic target.

Regulator of G-protein signaling 4 (RGS4) is a multifunctional signal transduction protein, widely expressed in the pain matrix.

Using genetically modified mice, we show a dynamic role of RGS4 in recovery from symptoms of sensory hypersensitivity deriving from hindpaw inflammation or hindlimb nerve injury. We also demonstrate an important role of RGS4 actions in gene expression patterns induced by chronic pain states in the mouse thalamus. Our findings provide novel insight into mechanisms associated with the maintenance of chronic pain states and demonstrate that interventions in RGS4 activity promote recovery from sensory hypersensitivity symptoms.",11.0,2.75,False,"['F', '-', 'F', 'F', 'F', '-', 'F', 'F', 'M', 'F', 'F', '-', '-', 'F']","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai', None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 7135, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 85, None, None]",8,1,7.722191834067995e-05,-1,1,0.1360157,0.49982550740242,0.5134298801422119,0.4573875069618225,0.412906140089035,0.4215180277824402,1.0,36.0,16.0,358.0,176,93.9970930232558,0.6675824175824175,0.3076923076923077,2.071428571428572,7.333642857142877

In this study, we take one step back and investigate a more feasible application scenario of automatic patch generation, that is, using generated patches as debugging aids. We recruited 95 participants for a controlled experiment, in which they performed debugging tasks with the aid of either buggy locations (i.e., the control group), or generated patches of varied qualities. We observe that: a) high-quality patches significantly improve debugging correctness; b) such improvements are more obvious for difficult bugs; c) when using low-quality patches, participants' debugging correctness drops to an even lower point than that of the control group; d) debugging time is significantly affected not by debugging aids, but by participant type and the specific bug to fix. These results highlight that the benefits of using generated patches as debugging aids are contingent upon the quality of the patches.

This ontology consists of hierarchical descriptions of objects and features from the application domain. Then, the expert can teach Disciple to solve problems in a way that resembles how the expert would teach a student. For instance, the expert defines a specific problem, helps the agent to understand each reasoning step toward the solution, and supervises and corrects the agent’s behavior, when it attempts to solve new problems.

We argue that problems in this domain can be classified in two categories that we shall call problems of reference and problems of synthesis. Since Sutherland's Sketchpad program [16], a large number of systems have addressed constraint satisfaction in terms of the representation of constraints sets as equation systems, which in turn are solved by numerical methods like local propagation, relaxation and Gaussian elimination. Here, we present an alternative framework. We argue that conceptualising constraint satisfaction as symbolic rather than “numerical” problems helps to clarify the notion of “constraint”, simplify solution methods, and to explain the intuitive inferential processes underlying the modification of drawings in the course of interactive drafting sessions.

There are now dozens of candidate products in the pipeline. Purpose Our purpose is to assess challenges that will arise in later-stage clinical development of these candidate health products and propose a strategy that would help bring the costs, risks, and finances for their clinical trials into a better, more sustainable balance. Methods We conducted a literature review of clinical trial-related publications, interviewed individuals sponsoring and conducting interventional clinical trials for neglected diseases, and analyzed data from Clinicaltrials.gov, a clinical trials registry, on neglected disease clinical trials initiating subject recruitment between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2009. We quantified Clinicaltrials.gov data into country-specific participation in clinical trials and aggregated them into geographic regions. We employed bioinformatics and keyword methods to classify trials by type of intervention, sponsor, study phase, and therapeutic area. Results Two substantial bottlenecks threaten our capacity to bring these candidate neglected disease therapies to those in need. First, the research and regulatory capacity in many neglected disease-endemic settings is not adequate to support the clinical trials that need to occur there in order to complete the development of these products. Second, even with expected attrition in the pipeline, current levels of financing are insufficient to support the clinical development of these products under current cost assumptions. Limitations The proportion of trials of relevant studies not registered on Clinicaltrials.gov is not known, but is thought to be smaller post-2005, after the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors initiated a policy requiring investigators to deposit information about trial design into an accepted clinical trials registry before beginning patient enrollment. Conclusions Realizing the promise of the neglected disease product pipeline will require not only increased funding for large-scale clinical trials and capacity building, but also greater attention to how these trials and their regulatory pathways can be improved to reduce unnecessary costs, delays, and risks to trial subjects. We propose a two-prong strategy: (1) adaptation and adoption of emerging research on ‘sensible guidelines’ for reducing large-scale, randomized clinical trial costs to the demands of the neglected disease product pipeline and (2) regional approaches to regulation and ethical review of clinical trials for health products for neglected diseases.",33.0,2.5384615384615383,False,"['-', '-', 'M']","[None, 'Questrom School of Business, Boston University', None]","[None, 8051, None]","[None, 76, None]",17,-1,4.889525766495648e-05,-1,1,0.057079416,0.6421644687652588,0.7345810532569885,0.5256847143173218,0.5784404873847961,0.450475126504898,0.0,47.0,21.0,383.0,208,93.2258064516129,0.6352040816326531,0.3596938775510204,2.071428571428572,-0.7863571428571277

They are defined by their capacity to initiate glioma in immunocompromised mice which precludes analysis of their interaction with immune cells. Macrophages dominate the immune cell composition in glioma. We hypothesized that stemness and immune evasion induced by macrophages are closed intertwined in glioma. By using mass cytometry and RNA sequencing, we reveal that in immunocompetent mice, FGL2 promotes the stem-like phenotypes of glioma cells in an expression level-dependent manner. Mechanistically, FGL2-producing glioma cells recruit macrophages into the tumor microenvironment and induce the macrophages to secrete CXCL7 via the CD16/SyK/PI3K/HIF1α pathways. CXCL7, in turn, enhances the stem-like functionality of glioma cells, resulting in an increase in tumor incidence and progression that can be blocked with a neutralizing anti-CXCL7 antibody. Clinically, the FGL2-CXCL7 paracrine loop positively correlated with a higher macrophage signature and poorer prognosis in glioma patients. Thus, glioma cells' stem-like functionality is regulated by FGL2 in the presence of macrophages, and the FGL2-CXCL7 paracrine signaling axis is critical for regulating this function.",1.0,0.5,False,"['-', '-', 'M', '-', '-', '-', 'F', 'M', '-', '-']","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",13,1,0.0024968275702304,-1,1,0.06885017,0.6364703774452211,0.6918988227844238,0.4613256156444549,0.4432533383369446,0.4092800617218017,1.0,35.0,9.0,179.0,110,91.29411764705884,0.6631578947368421,0.3210526315789473,2.0894736842105264,9.867026315789502

We study the intra relationship between bins of the histograms over respective radius values, resulting in intra line graphs. In this way, the method finds intra line graphs for both Canny and Sobel edge images of the input text lines. To identify the unique distribution for separation of graphics and scene texts, we explore the inter relationship between intra line graphs of Canny and Sobel edge image with respective medial axes values.

A major obstacle involves the differences in the levels of available information. In this work, we present REMI, which is a mining framework that handles varying degrees of information availability by providing a meta-solution to missing data. The framework core concept is the REMI layered stack architecture, offering two complementary approaches to dealing with missing information, namely data enrichment (DARE) and graceful degradation (GRADE). DARE aims at inference of missing information levels, while GRADE attempts to mine the patterns using only the existing data.We show that REMI provides multiple ways for re-usability, while being fault tolerant and enabling incremental development. One may apply the architecture to different problem instantiations within the same domain, or deploy it across various domains. Furthermore, we introduce the other three components of the REMI framework backing the layered stack. To support decision making in this framework, we show a mapping of REMI into an optimization problem (OTP) that balances the trade-off between three costs: inaccuracies in inference of missing data (DARE), errors when using less information (GRADE), and gathering of additional data. Further, we provide an experimental evaluation of REMI using real-world transportation data coming from two European smart cities, namely Dublin and Warsaw.",4.0,0.8,False,"['M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M']","[None, None, None, None, 'University of Toronto', None]","[None, None, None, None, 311, None]","[None, None, None, None, 23, None]",14,-1,6.229333966934692e-05,-1,-1,0.1191444,0.4387755393981933,0.7066097259521484,0.3856681585311889,0.4577946066856384,0.4906201362609863,0.0,39.0,10.0,224.0,142,93.6842105263158,0.6637554585152838,0.2794759825327511,2.061135371179039,7.1894475982533095

Design Prospective microbiological and observational study in a realistic simulated setting. Participants Ten anaesthetists supported by 10 anaesthetic technicians. Primary outcome measure The presence or absence of organisms cultured from sterile intravenous bags used to collect drugs injected during the simulated cases and from the needles and the contents of the syringes used. The authors also observed the aseptic techniques used. Results Organisms were isolated from five of 38 (13%) bags from five of 20 simulated cases anaesthetised by four of 10 anaesthetists, 10 of 197 (5%) syringes and six of 17 (35%) needles. None of the anaesthetists washed their hands prior to entry, used the hand gel provided, disinfected the phial septa before drawing up drugs or disinfected the intravenous ports on the intravenous administration set before use. One was seen to recap a needle left on a syringe for possible reuse. Three participants were observed to place equipment such as stethoscopes, drug charts and pens on top of their inuse drug trays. Conclusion The administration of intravenous drugs during anaesthesia may be an important factor in the genesis (or potentially the prevention) of healthcare-associated infection. These observations suggest room for improvement in the aseptic techniques of at least some anaesthetists when preparing and administering intravenous drugs.

Rotation, scale and translation invariant, are very important in image recognition. Some approaches of rotation invariant features have been introduced. Zernike Moments (ZMs) are the most widely used family of orthogonal moments due to their extra property of being invariant to an arbitrary rotation of the images. These moment invariants have been successfully used in the pattern recognition. For designing a high accuracy recognition system, a new and accurate way for feature extraction is inevitable. In order to have an accurate algorithm, after image segmentation, ZMs were used for feature extraction. After feature extraction, a classifier is needed; Support Vector Machine (SVM) can serve as a good classifier. For the N-class problem in iris classification, SVM applies N two-class machines. Indeed, in this type of validation, data are divided into K subsets. At any given moment, one is for testing and the other one is exclusively for validation. This method is called K-fold cross validation (Leave one out) and each subset is considered as an original series.

Transient GUS expression levels were higher in globular embryo clusters than in embryogenic calluses. The high level of transient expression coincided with stable expression of the uidA gene. The frequency of GUS-positive somatic embryos increased following continuous subculture of explants (once every 2 wk) on selection medium containing 200 mgl−1 cefotaxime and 25 mgl−1 kanamycin. After 10 subcultures, more than 95% of somatic embryos were GUS-positive. Cotyledonary embryos were transferred to a medium containing 14.4 μM gibberellic acid to induce germination and plantlet conversion. Transgenic plantlets were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern analysis. Each transgenic line was cloned by induction of embryogenic callus from roots and hypocotyls.

Proceedings.","""Flooding"" is a fundamental operation in unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing systems, such as Gnutella. Although it is effective in content search, flooding is very inefficient because it results in a great amount of redundant messages. Our study shows that more than 70% of the generated messages are redundant for a flooding with a TTL of 7 in a moderately connected network. Existing efforts to address this problem have been focused on limiting the use of flooding operations. We propose LightFlood, an efficient flooding scheme, with the objective of minimizing the number of redundant messages and retaining the same message propagating scope as that of standard flooding. By constructing a tree-like suboverlay within the existing P2P overlay called FloodNet, the flooding operation in LightFlood is divided into two stages. In the first stage, a message is propagated by using the standard flooding scheme with three or four TTL hops, through which the message can be spread to a sufficiently large scope with a small number of redundant messages. In the second stage, the message propagating is only conducted across the FloodNet, significantly reducing the number of redundant messages. Our analysis and simulation results show that the LightFlood scheme provides a low overhead broadcasting facility that can be effectively used in P2P searching. Compared with standard flooding used in Gnutella, we show that the LightFlood scheme with an additional 2 to 3 hops can reduce up to more than 69% of flooding messages, and retain the same flooding scope",128.0,6.4,False,"['-', 'F', '-']","[None, 'Google Inc.', None]","[None, None, None]","[None, 1, None]",13,-1,9.424380170113438e-05,-1,1,0.08565377,0.4437959790229797,0.6691421866416931,0.4445256292819977,0.4303299188613891,0.5427641272544861,1.0,29.0,10.0,248.0,129,91.4069264069264,0.5657370517928287,0.2310756972111553,1.828685258964144,26.95622709163348

The semantic gap between queries and keywords and the extremely high precision requirements (>= 95\%) are two major challenges to this task. To the best of our knowledge, the problem has not been openly discussed. In an industrial sponsored search system, the retrieved keywords for frequent queries are usually done ahead of time and stored in a lookup table. Considering these results as a seed dataset, we propose a data-augmentation-like framework to improve the synonymous retrieval performance for these frequent queries. This framework comprises two steps: translation-based retrieval and discriminant-based filtering. Firstly, we devise a Trie-based translation model to make a data increment. In this phase, a Bag-of-Core-Words trick is conducted, which increased the data increment's volume 4.2 times while keeping the original precision. Then we use a BERT-based discriminant model to filter out nonsynonymous pairs, which exceeds the traditional feature-driven GBDT model with 11\% absolute AUC improvement. This method has been successfully applied to Baidu's sponsored search system, which has yielded a significant improvement in revenue. In addition, a commercial Chinese dataset containing 500K synonymous pairs with a precision of 95\% is released to the public for paraphrase study (this http URL).",8.0,2.6666666666666665,False,"['-', '-', '-', '-', '-']","[None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None]",14,-1,5.286816904581116e-05,-1,1,0.039833553,0.3244850635528564,0.533195972442627,0.4410806894302368,0.3755027949810028,0.3835366070270538,1.0,38.0,11.0,206.0,132,93.31658291457286,0.6301369863013698,0.2922374429223744,1.9315068493150684,24.449020547945224

However, the increased complexity that comes with long-range interactions strongly hinders theoretical studies. This makes a quantum simulator for long-range models highly desirable. Here, we show that a chain of trapped ions can be used to quantum simulate a one-dimensional (1D) model of hard-core bosons with dipolar off-site interaction and tunneling, equivalent to a dipolar XXZ spin-1/2 chain. We explore the rich phase diagram of this model in detail, employing perturbative mean-field theory, exact diagonalization and quasi-exact numerical techniques (density-matrix renormalization group and infinite time-evolving block decimation). We find that the complete devil's staircase—an infinite sequence of crystal states existing at vanishing tunneling—spreads to a succession of lobes similar to the Mott lobes found in Bose–Hubbard models. Investigating the melting of these crystal states at increased tunneling, we do not find (contrary to similar 2D models) clear indications of supersolid behavior in the region around the melting transition.

It is shown that participants are only marginally capable of distinguishing between authentic and generated materials. By scrutinizing the linguistic features that influence the participants’ authenticity judgments, it is shown that linguistic properties such as ‘syntactic complexity’, ‘lexical diversity’ and ‘rhyme density’ add to the user’s perception of texts being authentic.

LMSs collect large amounts of data. Proper processing of such collected data can offer valuable insights about the learning process, support for higher quality education, insights on why some students drop out of courses, and so on. In this paper, we briefly review and discuss the global trends in digital learning and learning lnalytics (LA), specifically from the viewpoint of two LMS systems and related LA research, one in Finland and one in Sweden.

Such a framework provides dual benefits to an OSC: it enables sharing of unused resource during periods of low computing load while allowing execution of any long-term computation on public or anonym zed data at a very low cost during periods of high load. The ad-hoc and heterogeneous nature of the shared infrastructure make the resource management problem inRISC non-trivial -- a resource manager needs to: (i) maximize profit while determining incentives for resource owners and prices for resource users in an integrated manner, and (ii)emulate large-scale cloud-like robustness and capabilities out of unreliable, small-scale and intermittently available resources at a low cost. This leads to a constrained market situation where offered prices and incentives should lead to a desired level of SLA and reliability for the consumers. Existing approaches of incentive based scheduling for market-like grids assume an open market, based only on demand response, and thus are inapplicable for the constrained market situation in shared resources infrastructure. Specifically, RISC framework has two main components: (i) a first-of-a-kind Dynamic Pricing and Incentivization (DPI) strategy that computes the incentives and the prices while maximizing profit for RISC, using an epoch-by-epoch pricing feedback loop, and (ii) a DPI dependent Reliability, Cost and Seaware(RCS) scheduler that takes the resource reservation requests as input and assigns replicas of these requests tone or more shared resources for guaranteeing performanceSLAs and reliability, while minimizing the cost of resource reservations. Moreover, to handle the communication overhead of computing over geographically distributed resources, the scheduler strives to reduce the network cost of resource allocation. Results from extensive trace-driven experimentation show that our approach can indeed provide appropriate incentives for resource providers, and robust cost-efficient infrastructure solution for resource users.",5.0,0.625,False,"['-', 'M', '-', 'M']","[None, 'LinkedIn', None, None]","[None, 967, None, None]","[None, 60, None, None]",13,-1,6.452214729219312e-05,-1,-1,0.07175745,0.5711341500282288,0.6032302975654602,0.4595336616039276,0.4326825737953186,0.4081387817859649,0.0,54.0,8.0,318.0,187,92.72151898734175,0.6458333333333334,0.3154761904761904,2.0625,-8.049499999999966

Hard classification techniques assign mixed pixels to the class with the highest proportion of coverage or probability. Loss of information is inevitable during this process. Soft classification techniques were introduced to correct for this loss: they assign pixel fractions to the land cover classes corresponding to the represented area inside a pixel. The assignment of fractions to the different classes however, renders no information about the location of these fractions inside the pixel. Atkinson (1997) stated that it is possible to assign the fractions spatially to so called ’subpixels’. Every pixel is thus divided into a predefined number of sub-pixels, allowing a more spatially detailed representation of the lower resolution pixels. Sub-pixel mapping algorithms have been applied in a variety of forms and on fraction images of varying spatial resolutions, but all algorithms share one common property: accuracy assessment of sub-pixel mapping algorithms is impossible because of missing high resolution ground truth imagery. Therefore, high resolution reference classifications are degraded to yield artificial fraction images.

Their heat treatment at lower temperatures than is the cas e with classic powders results in polycrystals of very small grain sizes which possess enhanced me chanical properties. Although numerous methods of producing nanopowders were elaborated, serious processing problems ar e still encountered, mainly due to the friction between powder particles. It fol lows that dry pressing of such powders does not lead to satisfactory results. In the present wor k his is investigated using nanopowders in the yttria-zirconia system. A method for their synthes is under hydrothermal conditions is described. The effect of the two forming methods on the powde r behavior during sintering, dry pressing and pressure filtration, is shown. Introduction. Nearly all properties possessed by ceramic polycrystals are essentially dependent on the grain size. This is exceptionally clear in the case of nano-crystalline materials. It is customary to use this name, in case of polycrystals, when grain sizes are not larger than 100 – 150 nm. The mechanical strength of brittle materials is governed by sizes of the microstructural defects. The defect sizes are the smaller the smaller the polycrystall ine grain sizel, unless the method of preparation introduces other microstructural discontinuities. If this c ondition is met, the distribution of defect sizes becomes smaller with decreasing grain sizes and automatically the Weibull modulus increases, which improves the reliability of the material. Another eff ct of nanometric grain sizes is the easy deformation of a material at elevated temperatures. T his so called superplastic behaviour leads to surface defect healing which has a beneficial effect on the mechanical strength of the material. Sintering is the most frequently used method of manufacturing bulk cera mic polycrystals. This is also the case in nanometric materials, but it is often difficult to control grain growth at the same time as one is attempting to stimulate densification. This proces s is usually accompanied with tenfold or even higher grain growth. So, assuming the grain sizes of t he nanometric polycrystals given above, particle sizes of the starting powder should not exceed 15 – 30 nm. They are usually smaller and such fine powders tend to form mechanically strong aggl omerates. It is known that the mechanical strength of agglomerates is proportional to the square of the particle sizes [1]: Pc = K K 2 p F L d V 1",7.0,0.35,False,"['-', '-']","[None, None]","[None, None]","[None, None]",7,-1,6.841543042486012e-05,-1,1,0.041826267,0.3084613978862762,0.3586539626121521,0.3186684548854828,0.3785432279109955,0.274586021900177,1.0,41.0,23.0,401.0,223,92.07349081364828,0.6034912718204489,0.2394014962593516,1.890274314214464,27.53129301745639

However, few general synthetic methods exist to produce such materials in high yields and to precisely functionalize them. One strategy to form ordered 2D organic nanomaterials is through the supramolecular assembly of sequence-defined synthetic polymers. Peptoids, one such class of polymer, are designable bioinspired heteropolymers whose main-chain length and monomer sequence can be precisely controlled. We have recently discovered that individual peptoid polymers with a simple sequence of alternating hydrophobic and ionic monomers can self-assemble into highly ordered, free-floating nanosheets. A detailed understanding of their molecular structure and supramolecular assembly dynamics provides a robust platform for the discovery of new classes of nanosheets with tunable properties and novel applications. In this Account, we discuss the discovery, characterization, assembly, molecular modeling, and functionalization of peptoid nanosheets. The fundamental properties of peptoid nanosheets, their mechanism of formation, and their application as robust scaffolds for molecular recognition and as templates for the growth of inorganic minerals have been probed by an arsenal of experimental characterization techniques (e.g., scanning probe, electron, and optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, surface-selective vibrational spectroscopy, and surface tensiometry) and computational techniques (coarse-grained and atomistic modeling). Peptoid nanosheets are supramolecular assemblies of 16-42-mer chains that form molecular bilayers. They span tens of microns in lateral dimensions and freely float in water. Their component chains are highly ordered, with chains nearly fully extended and packed parallel to one another as a result of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. Nanosheets form via a novel interface-catalyzed monolayer collapse mechanism. Peptoid chains first assemble into a monolayer at either an air-water or oil-water interface, on which peptoid chains extend, order, and pack into a brick-like pattern. Upon mechanical compression of the interface, the monolayer buckles into stable bilayer structures. Recent work has focused on the design of nanosheets with tunable properties and functionality. They are readily engineerable, as functional monomers can be readily incorporated onto the nanosheet surface or into the interior. For example, functional hydrophilic ""loops"" have been displayed on the surfaces of nanosheets. These loops can interact with specific protein targets, serving as a potentially general platform for molecular recognition. Nanosheets can also bind metal ions and serve as 2D templates for mineral growth. Through our understanding of the formation mechanism, along with predicted features ascertained from molecular modeling, we aim to further design and synthesize nanosheets as robust protein mimetics with the potential for unprecedented functionality and stability.",132.0,18.857142857142858,True,"['-', 'F', 'F', '-', '-', 'F', 'M', '-']","[None, None, None, 'KPMG', None, None, 'Staff Scientist, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab', None]","[None, None, None, 187, None, None, 1854, None]","[None, None, None, 19, None, None, 55, None]",12,-1,0.0013302015099117,-1,1,0.034442514,0.6058821082115173,0.5627098679542542,0.6238651871681213,0.4195061326026916,0.5074205994606018,0.0,69.0,20.0,409.0,230,93.96039603960396,0.6533018867924528,0.3938679245283019,2.1910377358490565,0.6657075471698306

Here we investigate the structural basis for M. tuberculosis associated bedaquiline resistance in the drug target, AtpE. Together with the 9 previously identified resistance-associated variants in AtpE, 54 non-resistance-associated mutations were identified through comparisons of bedaquiline susceptibility across 23 different mycobacterial species. Computational analysis of the structural and functional consequences of these variants revealed that resistance associated variants were mainly localized at the drug binding site, disrupting key interactions with bedaquiline leading to reduced binding affinity. This was used to train a supervised predictive algorithm, which accurately identified likely resistance mutations (93.3% accuracy). Application of this model to circulating variants present in the Asia-Pacific region suggests that current circulating variants are likely to be susceptible to bedaquiline.

Methods Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells labeled with 3H-TdR were injected into 30 irradiated mdx mice via tail vein or intraperitoneal cavity, in a quantity of 4×106 per mice. The radioactivity concentration of blood, heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, muscle, brain and bone marrow were detected at 24-hour, 48-hour, 2-week, 1-month, 2-month, 4-month points after infusion and calculated by %ID/g with liquid scintillation counting. Results ① Radioactivity concentration of brain and bone marrow reached the highest level at 2-week time point after infusion via tail vein, but that of heart and muscle did at 4-month point. At early time, the stem cells mainly distributed in lung, liver and bone marrow, then at 2-month point the distribution in muscle and heart muscle was increased but still less than that in bone marrow. ② The time for radioactivity concentration of blood, lung, kidney, spleen, brain to reach the peak was retarded via peritoneal cavity than that via tail vein. At early time, the concentration in lung, liver and bone marrow was similar to that via tail vein, the concentration of muscle was lower than that of the bone marrow at 2-month point. ③Radioactivity concentration of heart, muscle, brain, bone marrow was much higher via tail vein compared to that via peritoneal cavity, showing a statistical significance (P0.01). Conclusions Radioactivity concentration in muscle reaches the highest level at 4-month point after infusion and is influenced by different infusion portals. 3H-TdR should be an excellent tracer for observing the dynamic distribution of stem cells for a longer time.",1.0,0.0588235294117647,False,['-'],[None],[None],[None],18,-1,5.540522487916679e-05,-1,1,0.041123964,0.4324476420879364,0.5917617678642273,0.4432847797870636,0.4367889165878296,0.4071773290634155,1.0,57.0,13.0,279.0,117,93.82671480144404,0.6868686868686869,0.1885521885521885,1.7474747474747474,18.500136363636383

Adding such specialized adjacency structures is not at all straightforward due to the complexity of typical RDBMS implementations. The iterative nature of graph queries also practically requires a form of runtime compilation and native code generation which adds another dimension of complexity to the RDBMS implementation and any potential extensions. In this paper, we demonstrate how the idea of the first Futamura projection, which links interpreted query engines and compilers through specialization, can be applied to compile graph workloads in an efficient way that simplifies the construction of relational engines which also support graph workloads.

Yet, little is known about the internal regulation via miRNAs in T. gondii. Therefore, we predicted pre-miRNAs directly from the type II ME49 genome and filtered them. For the confident hairpins, we predicted the location of the mature miRNAs and established their target genes. To add further confidence, we evaluated whether the hairpins and their targets were co-expressed. Such co-expressed miRNA and target pairs define a functional interaction. We extracted all such functional interactions and analyzed their differential expression among strains of all three clonal lineages (RH, PLK, and CTG) and between the two stages present in the intermediate host (tachyzoites and bradyzoites). Overall, we found ~65,000 expressed interactions of which ~5,500 are differentially expressed among strains but none are significantly differentially expressed between developmental stages.

With its rapid spread, since the beginning of the outbreak in December 2019, the disease transmitted by SARS-Cov2 has already caused over 400 thousand deaths to date. The diagnosis of the disease has an important role in combating Covid-19. Proposed method In this work, we propose a web system, Heg.IA, which seeks to optimize the diagnosis of Covid-19 through the use of artificial intelligence. The main ideia is that healthcare professionals can insert 41 hematological parameters from common blood tests and arterial gasometry into the system. Then, Heg.IA will provide a diagnostic report. It will indicate if the patient is infected with SARS-Cov2 virus, and also predict the type of hospitalization (regular ward, semi-ICU, or ICU). We developed a web system called Heg.IA to support decision-making regarding to diagnosis of Covid-19 and to the indication of hospitalization on regular ward, semi-ICU or ICU. This application is based on decision trees in a Random Forest architecture with 90 trees. The system showed to be highly efficient, with great results for both Covid-19 diagnosis and to recommend hospitalization.

As for the indication of hospitalization, we achieved excellent performance of accuracies above 99% and more than 0.99 for the other metrics in all situations. By using a computationally simple method, based on the classical decision trees, we were able to achieve high diagnosis performance.

As permanent hardware improvements make it possible to readily obtain digital images with higher and higher resolutions at ever-increasing frame rates, the efficiency of image registration methods is becoming increasingly important. Another aspect of this problem is the desire to improve the accuracy of these methods, which in general implies additional computational time. This problem is addressed by applying the inverse compositional Gauss-Newton (IC-GN) algorithm, which is modified to include the parametric sum of squared differences (PSSD) correlation criterion. However, the classical IC-GN algorithm with the sum of squared differences (SSD) correlation criterion cannot be used in cases in which lighting variations are of considerable importance. In this paper, a solution to this disadvantage is presented. The lighting variation is directly included in the IC-GN minimization procedure, which reduces the additional calculation time. Moreover, this IC-GN algorithm does not need to re-evaluate and invert the Hessian matrix. This results in a more computationally efficient algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is insensitive to the linear intensity variation in the target image; consequently, it has a faster convergence rate than the IC-GN algorithm with the zero-mean normalized sum of squared differences (ZNSSD) correlation criterion. As a result, computational time can be reduced by up to 30% in the case of convergence condition 𝜖=0.001. Owing to the above mentioned advantages of the proposed IC-GN algorithm, it could become a new standard for efficient and robust full-field displacement tracking in image sequences with varying lighting intensity.",9.0,1.5,False,"['-', '-']","[None, 'Professor of Mechatronics, University of Ljubljana']","[None, 411]","[None, 26]",13,-1,6.427061544605181e-05,-1,1,0.0546928,0.6965620517730713,0.682741641998291,0.4312715530395508,0.5155771374702454,0.7204594612121582,1.0,48.0,12.0,270.0,156,92.65037593984962,0.6258741258741258,0.3426573426573426,2.031468531468532,12.13526223776222

With the help of a computer-aided diagnosis system, the efficiency increased, and the cost was reduced for the cancer diagnosis. Traditional breast cancer classification techniques are based on handcrafted features techniques, and their performance relies upon the chosen features. They also are very sensitive to different sizes and complex shapes. However, histopathological breast cancer images are very complex in shape. Currently, deep learning models have become an alternative solution for diagnosis, and have overcome the drawbacks of classical classification techniques. Although deep learning has performed well in various tasks of computer vision and pattern recognition, it still has some challenges. One of the main challenges is the lack of training data. To address this challenge and optimize the performance, we have utilized a transfer learning technique which is where the deep learning models train on a task, and then fine-tune the models for another task. We have employed transfer learning in two ways: Training our proposed model first on the same domain dataset, then on the target dataset, and training our model on a different domain dataset, then on the target dataset. We have empirically proven that the same domain transfer learning optimized the performance. Our hybrid model of parallel convolutional layers and residual links is utilized to classify hematoxylin–eosin-stained breast biopsy images into four classes: invasive carcinoma, in-situ carcinoma, benign tumor and normal tissue. To reduce the effect of overfitting, we have augmented the images with different image processing techniques.

The new convexification function is based on that used in aBB, but it is enhanced with extra convex parametric terms. The Hessian matrix of the new convexification function is a constant non-diagonal matrix. The values of the parameters are determined in such a way that the effect of the off-diagonal elements in the overall underestimating function is minimized. As a result, the new underestimator is tighter than that produced by aBB.

The CHO cells included human TGF-β1 cDNA in conjunction with a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene, which was cotransfected into the cells to amplify the transfected TGF-β1 cDNA. As a first-round screening of the transfected cells, a relatively high TGF-β1-producing cell line was selected, and then, it acquired a resistance to increasing concentrations of methotrexate (MTX) up to 60 μM, resulting in a significant improvement in its TGF-β1 biosynthetic ability.

The 2νECEC half-life is an important observable for nuclear structure models8–14 and its measurement represents a meaningful step in the search for neutrinoless double electron capture—the detection of which would establish the Majorana nature of the neutrino and would give access to the absolute neutrino mass15–17.

Prominent among MA-PM interactions is electrostatic attraction between the positively charged MA domain and the negatively charged plasma membrane inner leaflet. Previously, we reported that membrane association of HIV-1 Gag, as well as purified Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) MA and Gag, depends strongly on the presence of acidic lipids and is enhanced by cholesterol (Chol). The mechanism underlying this enhancement was unclear. Here, using a broad set of in vitro and in silico techniques we addressed molecular mechanisms of association between RSV MA and model membranes, and investigated how Chol enhances this association. In neutron scattering experiments with liposomes in the presence or absence of Chol, MA preferentially interacted with preexisting POPS-rich clusters formed by nonideal lipid mixing, binding peripherally to the lipid headgroups with minimal perturbation to the bilayer structure. Molecular dynamics simulations showed a stronger MA-bilayer interaction in the presence of Chol, and a large Chol-driven increase in lipid packing and membrane surface charge density. Although in vitro MA-liposome association is influenced by disparate variables, including ionic strength and concentrations of Chol and charged lipids, continuum electrostatic theory revealed an underlying dependence on membrane surface potential. Together, these results conclusively show that Chol affects RSV MA-membrane association by making the electrostatic potential at the membrane surface more negative, while decreasing the penalty for lipid headgroup desolvation.

Injection sclerotherapy of internal hemorrhoids is one of the non-surgical treatments, and is simple, safe and feasible. Conventionally sclerotherapy is performed with rigid proctoscope which has limitations of maneuverability, narrower field of vision and documentation compared to flexible videoendoscope. Therefore, we assessed the efficacy and safety of video-colonoscopic sclerotherapy for bleeding internal hemorrhides. Methods: Seventy-nine patients of bleeding internal hemorrhoids were subjected to colonoscopic sclerotherapy using 1.5% polidocanol in retroflexed or forward viewing positions. Success of treatment was defined as cessation of bleeding for six weeks. Patients were observed for complications and were followed up regularly for 3 months. Results: A total of 79 evaluable patients, 61 had grade II and 18 had grade III hemorrhoids. There was no statistically significant differences in achieving excellent or good results for control of bleeding between patients with grade II and grade III hemorrhoids (100% vs 94,5%; p >0.05). The number of sessions of sclerotherapy required were significantly more in grade II than grade III hemorrhoids (1.1 ± 0.3 vs 1.3 ± 0.7; p = 0.04). No significant complications were noted except for bloating in ten patients (12.6 %) and rectal pain in 6 (7.6%) patients. Median time taken for the procedure was 30 minutes. Conclusions: Video-endoscopic sclerotherapy is safe, well-tolerated and effective treatment for bleeding internal hemorrhoids.",7.0,0.5833333333333334,False,"['-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-']","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",11,-1,5.60582875259501e-05,-1,1,0.09712017,0.5959864258766174,0.6560164093971252,0.5212234258651733,0.5641475319862366,0.5806679725646973,1.0,45.0,16.0,228.0,133,89.97737556561086,0.6846473029045643,0.2738589211618257,2.029045643153527,17.41523858921167

Although epidemiological studies have reported positive associations between circulating urate levels and cardiometabolic diseases, causality remains uncertain.


OBJECTIVES
Through a Mendelian randomization approach, we assessed whether serum urate levels are causally relevant in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), coronary heart disease (CHD), ischemic stroke, and heart failure (HF).


METHODS
This study investigated 28 single nucleotide polymorphisms known to regulate serum urate levels in association with various vascular and nonvascular risk factors to assess pleiotropy. To limit genetic confounding, 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms exclusively associated with serum urate levels were used in a genetic risk score to assess associations with the following cardiometabolic diseases (cases/controls): T2DM (26,488/83,964), CHD (54,501/68,275), ischemic stroke (14,779/67,312), and HF (4,526/18,400). As a positive control, this study also investigated our genetic instrument in 3,151 gout cases and 68,350 controls.


RESULTS
Serum urate levels, increased by 1 SD due to the genetic score, were not associated with T2DM, CHD, ischemic stroke, or HF. These results were in contrast with previous prospective studies that did observe increased risks of these 4 cardiometabolic diseases for an equivalent increase in circulating urate levels. However, a 1 SD increase in serum urate levels due to the genetic score was associated with increased risk of gout (odds ratio: 5.84; 95% confidence interval: 4.56 to 7.49), which was directionally consistent with previous observations.


CONCLUSIONS
Evidence from this study does not support a causal role of circulating serum urate levels in T2DM, CHD, ischemic stroke, or HF. Decreasing serum urate levels may not translate into risk reductions for cardiometabolic conditions.",136.0,19.428571428571427,True,"['-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', 'F', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-']","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",15,-1,0.0058653383607971,-1,1,0.04177191,0.7306582927703857,0.674886167049408,0.6395848393440247,0.543409526348114,0.5220336318016052,0.0,2.888888888888889,0.8333333333333334,14.22222222222222,152,97.18503937007874,0.7445255474452555,0.3211678832116788,2.102189781021898,-14.35075547445254

In a real scenario, such distance as well as other elements of the location problem can be uncertain or linguistically (vaguely) defined by the decision maker. In this paper, we manage flexibility in the coverage distance through a fuzzy constraint. So, an extension of the original MCLP model is proposed, which is solved by using a parametric approach.

Results confirmed the predicted relationship between high-information-content musical events, the violation of musical expectations (in corresponding ratings), and emotional reactions (psychologically and physiologically).

This ubiquitination facilitates methylation of histone H3 at K4 and K79, and accounts for the roles of Bre1 and its homologs in transcriptional regulation. Recent studies by others suggested that Bre1 acts as a tumor suppressor, augmenting expression of select tumor suppressor genes and suppressing select oncogenes. In this study, we present an additional mechanism of tumor suppression by Bre1 through maintenance of genomic stability. We track the evolution of genomic instability in Bre1-deficient cells from replication-associated double-strand breaks (DSB) to specific genomic rearrangements that explain a rapid increase in DNA content and trigger breakage-fusion-bridge cycles. We show that aberrant RNA-DNA structures (R-loops) constitute a significant source of DSBs in Bre1-deficient cells. Combined with a previously reported defect in homologous recombination, generation of R-loops is a likely initiator of replication stress and genomic instability in Bre1-deficient cells.

Two novel data‐driven network construction approaches are presented. These methods rely on connecting different brain regions using either extent or intensity of language related activations as identified by independent component analysis of fMRI. An auditory word definition decision task paradigm was used to activate the language network for 29 patients and 30 controls. Evaluations illustrated that pediatric epilepsy is associated with a network efficiency reduction. Patients showed a propensity to inefficiently use the whole brain network to perform the language task; whereas, controls seemed to efficiently use smaller segregated network components to achieve the same task. To explain the causes of the decreased efficiency, graph theoretical analysis was performed. The analysis revealed substantial global network feature differences between the patients and controls for the extent of activation network. It also showed that for both subject groups the language network exhibited small‐world characteristics; however, the patient's extent of activation network showed a tendency toward randomness. It was also shown that the intensity of activation network displayed ipsilateral hub reorganization on the local level. We finally showed that a clustering scheme was able to fairly separate the subjects into their respective patient or control groups.

Some histone modification, for example di-methylated histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me2), has been shown to bind to promoters and activate target genes. However, no clear pattern has been shown to predict human promoters. This paper proposed a novel quantitative approach to characterize patterns of promoter regions and predict novel and alternative promoters. We utilized high-throughput data generated using chromatin immunoprecipitation methods followed by massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) technology on RNA Polymerase II (Pol-II) and H3K4me2. Common patterns of promoter regions are modeled using a mixture model involving double-exponential and uniform distributions. The fitted model obtained were then used to search for regions displaying similar patterns over the entire genome to find novel and alternative promoters. Regions with high correlations with the common patterns are identified as putative novel promoters. We used this proposed algorithm, RNA-seq data and several transcripts databases to find alternative promoters in MCF7 (normal breast cancer) cell line. We found 7,235 high-confidence regions that display the identified promoter patterns. Of these, 4,167 regions (58%) can be mapped to RefSeq regions. 2,444 regions are in a gene body or overlap with transcripts (non-coding RNAs, ESTs, and transcripts that are predicted by RNA-seq data). Some of these maybe potential alternative promoters. We also found 193 regions that map to enhancer regions (represented by androgen and estrogen receptor binding sites) and other regulatory regions such as CTCF (CCCTC binding factor) and CpG island. Around 5% (431 regions) of these correlated regions do not overlap with any transcripts or regulatory regions suggesting that these might be potential new promoters or markers for other annotation which are currently undiscovered.",8.0,0.7272727272727273,False,"['-', '-', '-', '-']","[None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None]",9,-1,6.579464888912477e-05,-1,1,0.04298948,0.5292924046516418,0.5755305290222168,0.4742458164691925,0.560020387172699,0.4722040593624115,1.0,51.0,15.0,300.0,172,93.08219178082192,0.6666666666666666,0.2628205128205128,1.996794871794872,16.185153846153867

Currently, it is a challenging task to distinguish true interactions from other nearby non-interacting ones since the power of traditional experimental methods is limited due to low resolution or low throughput.ResultsWe propose a novel computational framework EP2vec to assay three-dimensional genomic interactions. We first extract sequence embedding features, defined as fixed-length vector representations learned from variable-length sequences using an unsupervised deep learning method in natural language processing. Then, we train a classifier to predict EPIs using the learned representations in supervised way. Experimental results demonstrate that EP2vec obtains F1 scores ranging from 0.841~ 0.933 on different datasets, which outperforms existing methods. We prove the robustness of sequence embedding features by carrying out sensitivity analysis. Besides, we identify motifs that represent cell line-specific information through analysis of the learned sequence embedding features by adopting attention mechanism. Last, we show that even superior performance with F1 scores 0.889~ 0.940 can be achieved by combining sequence embedding features and experimental features.ConclusionsEP2vec sheds light on feature extraction for DNA sequences of arbitrary lengths and provides a powerful approach for EPIs identification.",44.0,8.8,False,"['-', '-', 'M']","['Stanford Univeristy', 'Alibaba Group (now); Tsinghua University (past)', None]","[34, 48, None]","[4, 9, None]",8,-1,5.738759521437678e-05,-1,1,0.040390603,0.4586328268051148,0.5393379926681519,0.5768158435821533,0.4108974635601043,0.4286982119083404,0.0,28.0,11.0,198.0,145,96.59685863874346,0.7345971563981043,0.4170616113744075,2.2606635071090047,-9.58913270142176

Most of the approaches in predicting functional properties of proteins require to either identify a reliable set of labeled proteins with similar attribute features to unannotated proteins, or to learn from a fully-labeled protein interaction network with a large amount of labeled data. However, acquiring such labels can be very difficult in practice, especially for multi-label protein function prediction problems. Learning with only a few labeled data can lead to poor performance as limited supervision knowledge can be obtained from similar proteins or from connections between them. To effectively annotate proteins even in the paucity of labeled data, it is important to take advantage of all data sources that are available in this problem setting, including interaction networks, attribute feature information, correlations of functional labels, and unlabeled data.ResultsIn this paper, we show that the underlying nature of predicting functional properties of proteins using various data sources of relational data is a typical collective classification (CC) problem in machine learning. The protein functional prediction task with limited annotation is then cast into a semi-supervised multi-label collective classification (SMCC) framework. As such, we propose a novel generative model based SMCC algorithm, called GM-SMCC, to effectively compute the label probability distributions of unannotated protein instances and predict their functional properties. To further boost the predicting performance, we extend the method in an ensemble manner, called EGM-SMCC, by utilizing multiple heterogeneous networks with various latent linkages constructed to explicitly model the relationships among the nodes for effectively propagate the supervision knowledge from labeled to unlabeled nodes.ConclusionExperimental results on a yeast gene dataset predicting the functions and localization of proteins demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

This paper extends Markov logic to infinite domains, by casting it in the framework of Gibbs measures (Georgii, 1988). We show that a Markov logic network (MLN) admits a Gibbs measure as long as each ground atom has a finite number of neighbors. Many interesting cases fall in this category. We also show that an MLN admits a unique measure if the weights of its non-unit clauses are small enough. We then examine the structure of the set of consistent measures in the non-unique case. Many important phenomena, including systems with phase transitions, are represented by MLNs with non-unique measures. We relate the problem of satisfiability in first-order logic to the properties of MLN measures, and discuss how Markov logic relates to previous infinite models.",1.0,0.0625,False,"['M', 'M']","['Indian Institute of Technology Delhi', 'Professor of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington']","[110, None]","[9, 139]",5,-1,7.058701601549546e-05,-1,1,0.106353745,0.5217940211296082,0.6484097242355347,0.4232867956161499,0.3714400231838226,0.4407260715961456,0.0,32.0,10.0,179.0,107,93.67469879518072,0.6021505376344086,0.2311827956989247,1.806451612903225,35.84069354838712

The template should be represented by a set of points Y and marked with the key points for the model (landmarks). The template is personalized by the non-rigid registration of the set Y with the set of points X that represents patient’s tomogram. Presently, the coherent point drift (CPD) is the most popular method for solving the problem of non-rigid alignment. In this paper, we propose and explore an approach that substantially improves the CPD result in the problem of automatic registration of cephalometric points (CPs). The proposed algorithm remains robust in the presence of significant skull deformations. Traditionally, 3D cephalometry uses the geometric descriptor of a CP, which refines the position of the point on the bone surface. However, the result of applying the descriptor depends significantly on the accuracy of its anatomical basis reconstruction. The proposed approach solves this problem by clarifying the basis of geometric descriptors, the supporting elements of which are orbital planes and the Frankfurt (orbital-ear) horizontal. For this purpose, additionally marked points of the orbitals (YO) are included into the template Y. Once Y and X are aligned by the CPD method, the plane positions of the orbitals are refined by solving a linear regression problem on the subsets of YO for the left and right orbitals. Cases of refinement with and without use of Tikhonov regularization (ridge-regression) are analyzed. The effect of the increase in the cardinality of the set X relative to Y on the registration accuracy is investigated. It is found that the condition |X| < |Y| has a negative effect on the accuracy, which increases when the cardinality of X relative to Y decreases. The refinement of CPs by the geometric descriptor is carried out on tomogram data in the region around CPs that is found by the CPD method. The dimensions of this region along three coordinates are determined by the anatomical domain of a particular CP descriptor. The quality of the algorithm is measured by the Euclidean distance between hand-marked and automatically found points. The template Y for the algorithm is built on a trauma-deformed skull. The algorithm is quantitatively verified by registering the CPs of orbitals and cheekbones from the data of four tomograms for the deformed skull. A key feature and source of high accuracy of the approach is the use of linear regression with Tikhonov regularization to refine it. As a result, 81.25% of the points found fall within a radius of 2 mm from the hand-marked points and 100% of the points fall within a radius of 4 mm.",3.0,0.6,False,"['-', '-', '-']","['Medical University of Vienna', None, None]","[2, None, None]","[2, None, None]",14,-1,0.0004965042559785,-1,1,0.08061333,0.5393759608268738,0.5690699815750122,0.4356247186660766,0.7492796182632446,0.4798738956451416,1.0,56.0,20.0,451.0,189,85.16930022573364,0.5399568034557235,0.2505399568034557,1.8142548596112311,31.52653887688988

High-lead bump and eutectic SnPb cladding were used on Si die and the substrate sides, respectively. The reflow peak temperature was 260 °C for compatibility with passive components attach using lead-free solder. Flip chip bump cracking occurred at high-lead solder close to the die side. The cracking was eliminated by lowering the reflow peak temperature down to 225 °C. Main cause of the cracking at 260 °C reflow was attributed to the extensive Sn diffusion into high lead bump. This decreased the melting point of the high-lead solder around the die side, which in turn worsened the adhesion between solder and die due to the coexistence of solid and liquid. Diffusion length estimation showed both of the liquid- and solid-state diffusions of Sn. Crack gap in the solder bump was consistent with thermal expansion mismatch between Si die and organic substrate. The bump cracking was mitigated by use of 225 °C reflow, limiting Sn diffusion and providing a good integrity of high lead bumps on die side.",6.0,0.5454545454545454,False,"['-', '-', '-', '-', '-']","[None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None]",14,-1,5.671904740038745e-05,-1,1,0.14248572,0.5603907108306885,0.6492791771888733,0.622311532497406,0.4171209633350372,0.5287812948226929,1.0,18.0,10.0,187.0,93,89.70930232558139,0.6666666666666666,0.1822916666666666,1.6979166666666667,44.21075000000002

STACS-based algorithms train HMMs up to five times faster than Baum-Welch, avoid the overfitting problem commonly encountered in learning large state-space HMMs using Expectation Maximization (EM) methods such as Baum-Welch, and achieve superior classification results on a very diverse dataset with minimal pre-processing.

Many downstream applications require comprehensive analysis like geographic information retrieval, recommender systems, geographic knowledge graphs, and in general, understanding urban spaces [28]. Points of Interests (POI), as one of the most researched aspects of urban data, has been successfully modeled using concepts borrowed from Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). In the work of Place2Vec [28], a Word2Vec-like statistical model is proposed to represent spatial adjacency with a continuous embedding space. This method successfully models the functional semantics of POIs with regard to several human-assessment based evaluations. However, though the Place2Vec model addresses the distributional heterogeneity within a given spatial context with ITDL augmentation, it does not address the spatial heterogeneity among different regions. To solve this problem, we propose to introduce a hierarchical, density-based, self-adjusting clustering mechanism. The boundary of relatedness and unrelatedness is learned from the given context, where denser areas have tighter bounds while sparser areas have looser ones. We train our model on both the baseline Yelp hierarchical dataset [28] and our OpenStreetMap dataset. We demonstrate that 1) our model significantly improves the performance on 2 of the 3 baseline tasks and the stability of training, and 2) our model generalizes excellently across 112 cities of radically different scales (minimum 1725 POIs, maximum 2694070 POIs), regions (North America, Europe, Asia, Africa) and types (commercial, touristy, industrial, etc.) without the need of adjusting or tuning any hyperparameters.

Fillatre'}]",Signal Process.,This paper develops a multihypothesis testing framework for calculating numerically the optimal minimax test with discrete observations and an arbitrary loss function. Discrete observations are common in data processing and make tractable the calculation of the minimax test. Each hypothesis is both associated to a parameter defining the distribution of the observations and to an action which describes the decision to take when the hypothesis is true. The loss function measures the gap between the parameters and the actions. The minimax test minimizes the maximum classification risk. It is the solution of a finite linear programming problem which gives the worst case classification risk and the worst case prior distribution.

We develop asymptotically optimal algorithms from instance-dependent lower-bounds using iterative saddle-point solvers. Our approach generalises recent iterative methods for pure exploration to reward maximisation, where a major challenge arises from the estimation of the sub-optimality gaps and their reciprocals. Still we manage to achieve all the above desiderata.

We aimed to determine whether BRBs combat PDAC by modulating cancer immunity. NOD.SCID mice lacking T and B cells were injected with human Panc-1-Luc cells orthotopically, and immunocompetent Kras LSL.G12D/+ -Trp53 LSL.R172H/+ -Pdx-1-Cre mice were fed BRBs. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from PDAC patients were treated with butyrate, a microbial metabolite of BRBs. The absence of T and B cells did not dampen BRBs' anti-tumor effects in the NOD.SCID mice. In the Kras LSL.G12D/+ -Trp53 LSL.R172H/+ -Pdx-1-Cre mice, BRBs significantly prolonged survival (189 days versus 154 days). In both models, BRBs decreased tumor-infiltrating CD11b+ cells and the expression of IL-1β, sEH, and Ki67. BRBs also increased tumor-infiltrating NKp46+ cells and the expression of CD107a, a functional marker of cytolytic NK and CD8+ T cells. In Kras LSL.G12D/+ -Trp53 LSL.R172H/+ -Pdx-1-Cre mice, tumor infiltration of CD8+ T cells was increased by BRBs. Further using the PBMCs from PDAC patients, we show that butyrate decreased the population of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Butyrate also reversed CD11b+ cell-mediated suppression on CD8+ T cells. Interestingly, there is a negative association between MDSC changes and patients' survival, suggesting that the more decrease in MDSC population induced by butyrate treatment, the longer the patient had survived.

Method: A retrospective chart review of acoustic neuroma patients who completed a PANQOL survey between the dates of October 1, 2010 and January 1, 2012 was performed. A total of 76 patients (38 conservative, 38 gamma knife) were included. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and PANQOL data for the 2 groups were statistically analyzed. Results: Patient age, sex, percentage of extracanalicular tumors, and time elapsed from diagnosis to the PANQOL survey were not significantly different for the 2 groups. There was a statistically significant difference in tumor size between the 2 groups (CON 8.59 mm vs GK 16.45 mm, P ≤ .001). The differences in PANQOL composite scores for hearing, balance, facial nerve symptoms, pain, anxiety, and energy were not statistically significant. However, there was a statistically significant difference in the general composite score (CON 5.97 vs GK 5.32, P = .015). Conclusion: Despite significantly larger tumors, patients undergoing gamma knife experience a similar quality of life when compared to patients who are being conservatively managed. The use of disease-specific quality of life measures, such as the PANQOL, will contribute to the development of “best evidence” treatment strategies for patients with acoustic neuromas.",2.0,0.1818181818181818,False,"['-', '-', '-', '-']","[None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None]",9,-1,0.000584973202563,-1,1,0.100168236,0.4508931934833527,0.5115422606468201,0.6164683699607849,0.3872278928756714,0.3543806970119476,0.0,51.0,14.0,242.0,136,93.94273127753304,0.6923076923076923,0.3198380566801619,2.117408906882591,3.139206477732841

Experiments typically generate bright-field images of microplastic fibers that are filtered from water. Environmental decision making in process engineering critically relies on accurate quantification of mi-croplastic fibers in these images. To satisfy the required standards, images are often analyzed manually, resulting in a highly tedious process, with thousands of fiber instances per image. While the shape of individual fibers is relatively simple, it is difficult to separate them in highly crowded scenes with significant overlap. We propose a fiber instance detection pipeline, which decomposes the fiber detection and segmentation into manageable sub-problems. Well separated instances are identified with robust image processing techniques, such as adaptive thresholding, and morphological skeleton analysis, while tangled fibers are separated by an algorithm based on deep pixel embeddings. Moreover, we present a modified Intersection-over-Union metric as a more appropriate similarity metric for elongated shapes.

Methods Fifty-one participants were enrolled in this prospective study between July and October 2018 and underwent the three 3D MRCP sequences each. The acquisition time and relative duct-to-periductal contrast ratios (RC values) of each bile duct segment were obtained. Visualization of the bile and main pancreatic ducts, background suppression, artifacts, and overall image quality were scored on 5-point scales. Mean and median differences in RC values and qualitative scores of NT C-SENSE and BH C-SENSE relative to NT SENSE were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results Acquisition time of NT SENSE, NT C-SENSE, and BH C-SENSE were 348, 143 (mean for both), and 18 s (for all participants), respectively. The RC value of each bile duct segment was inferior, but the lower limits of the 95% CIs of the mean differences were ≥ − 0.10, for both NT C-SENSE and BH C-SENSE. The visualization score of the intrahepatic duct in BH C-SENSE was inferior to that in NT SENSE (lower 95% CI limit, − 1.5). In both NT C-SENSE and BH C-SENSE, the 95% CIs of the median differences in the other qualitative scores were from − 1.0 to 0.0.

Aim: This study aims to know the details of different phenotypes involved in inducible resistance to clindamycin in erythromycin resistant isolates and also the association of MRSA and the inducible resistance. 
Materials and Methods: 96 S.aureus isolates were subjected to routine antibiotic susceptibility testing including Erythromycin, Clindamycin and Cefoxitin by Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method. Inducible clindamycin resistance was detected by disc approximation test (D test) as per CLSI guidelines. Results: Among the 96 isolates tested, 59 (61.45%)were found to be MRSA and 37(38.54%) were MSSA. Of the 59 isolates,34(57.63%)showed inducible clindamycin resistance,14(23.73%) constitutive resistance and 11(18.64%).

Our approach requires access to an additional small, unlabeled reference dataset as the supervision signal, thus sidestepping the need for explicit labels on the underlying bias factors. Using this supplementary dataset, we detect the bias in existing datasets via a density ratio technique and learn generative models which efficiently achieve the twin goals of: 1) data efficiency by using training examples from both biased and reference datasets for learning; and 2) data generation close in distribution to the reference dataset at test time.

A number of physiologists have suggested that disparity might be encoded by a shift of receptive-eld position According to this position-shift model, disparity selective cells combine the outputs of similarly shaped, monocular receptive elds from diierent retinal positions in the left and right e y es. More recently, Ohzawa et al. (1990) and DeAngelis et al. (1991, 1995) have suggested that disparity sensitivity might instead be a result of interocular phase shifts. In this phase-shift model, the centers of the left-and right-eye receptive elds coincide, but the arrangement of receptive eld subregions is diierent. This chapter presents a formal description and analysis of a binocular energy model of disparity selectivity. According to this model, disparity selectivity results from a combination of position-shifts and/or phase-shifts. Our theoretical analysis suggests how one might perform an experiment to estimate the relative contributions of phase and position shifts to the disparity selectivity of binocular neurons, based on their responses to drifting sinusoidal grating stimuli of diierent spatial frequencies and disparities. We also show that for drifting grating stimuli, the binocular energy response (with phase and/or position shifts) is a sinusoidal function of disparity , consistent with the physiology of neurons in primary visual cortex (area 1",22.0,0.8461538461538461,False,"['-', '-', '-']","['Google Brain; University of Toronto; Universiity of Toronto Scarborough; Vector Institute', None, None]","[None, None, None]","[30, None, None]",8,-1,7.086326620752597e-05,-1,1,0.07213422,0.6330068111419678,0.5889926552772522,0.5997429490089417,0.5883272886276245,0.4965173006057739,1.0,34.0,8.0,241.0,127,90.02164502164503,0.6294820717131474,0.3027888446215139,1.9760956175298805,9.10581075697212

Since benefits depend not only on internal contingencies but also on the decisions and the loyalty of business partners, issues of trust and the risk of becoming locked in with a disloyal partner become crucial. The Internet and Web-based technologies facilitate system development and the deployment of inter-organizational systems and may thus help change this picture. In times where IT use is becoming more and more important to stay competitive and efficient, system costs and benefits have to be balanced very carefully in order to build systems that are perceived as being beneficial even in cases where risk-aversion makes this a difficult task. In this paper the issue is addressed with a focus on applications which link a buying organization with its suppliers. The paper introduces a generic framework for the evaluation of IT systems and networks that might help mitigate the lack of success measures. The framework is applied to a procurement support system that was developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and that is used to link the Lab with its suppliers. The case also provides an example for a system that balances costs and benefits in a way that makes the system advantageous even in an inter-organizational setting.",54.0,2.25,False,"['M', 'F']","[None, None]","[None, None]","[None, None]",9,-1,5.540522487916679e-05,-1,-1,0.03446817,0.4891254603862762,0.4880527853965759,0.4359104037284851,0.4592714011669159,0.3453780710697174,1.0,19.0,8.0,234.0,132,90.27397260273972,0.5481171548117155,0.2301255230125523,1.8702928870292888,18.86872175732219

To explore changes in current source density locations after remifentanil infusion in healthy volunteers using source localization of the electroencephalography (EEG).


METHODS
EEG data was collected from 21 males using a 62-electrode system. Additionally, cognitive performance was evaluated by a continuous reaction time paradigm, and pain scores were obtained for experimental bone and heat stimuli. Data were recorded before and during treatment with remifentanil and placebo. Source localization was performed by sLORETA at delta (1-3.9 Hz), theta (4-7.9 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta1 (12.1-18 Hz), and beta2 (18.1-30 Hz) frequency bands.

The results indicated that neurons in several brain areas including inferior frontal gyrus and insula at frontal lobe oscillated more strongly after remifentanil infusion compared to placebo. Furthermore, the source activity at delta band was correlated with continuous reaction time index.


CONCLUSIONS
These results indicate that alterations in brain oscillations during remifentanil are mostly localized to frontal, fronto-temporal and fronto-central lobes and related to cognitive function.


SIGNIFICANCE
The approach offers the potential to be used for understanding the underlying mechanism of action of remifentanil on brain activity.",12.0,1.5,False,"['M', 'F', '-', '-', '-', 'M', '-']","['Walmart Labs', None, None, None, None, None, None]","[150, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[19, None, None, None, None, None, None]",12,-1,7.197911994931083e-05,-1,1,0.09940188,0.3675564229488373,0.4867786467075348,0.3642154037952423,0.4037264287471771,0.5340095162391663,0.0555555555555555,2.4444444444444446,0.8888888888888888,11.27777777777778,137,91.16161616161617,0.7155963302752294,0.3165137614678899,2.169724770642202,-6.158715596330268

Barták'}]",Encyclopedia of Artificial Intelligence,"INTRODUCTION Constraints appear in many areas of human endeavour starting from puzzles like crosswords (the words can only overlap at the same letter) and recently popular Sudoku (no number appears twice in a row) through everyday problems such as planning a meeting (the meeting room must accommodate all participants) till solving hard optimization problems for example in manufacturing scheduling (a job must finish before another job). Though all these problems look like being from completely different worlds, they all share a similar base – the task is to find values of decision variables, such as the start time of the job or the position of the number at a board, respecting given constraints. This problem is called a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). Constraint processing emerged from AI research in 1970s (Montanary, 1974) when problems such as scene labelling were studied (Waltz, 1975). The goal of scene labelling was to recognize a type of line (and then a type of object) in the 2D picture of a 3D scene. The possible types were convex, concave, and occlud-ing lines and the combination of types was restricted at junctions of lines to be physically feasible. This scene labelling problem is probably the first problem formalised as a CSP and some techniques developed for solving this problem, namely arc consistency, are still in the core of constraint processing. Systematic use of constraints in programming systems has started in 1980s when researchers identified a similarity between unification in logic programming and constraint satisfaction (Gallaire, 1985) (Jaffar & Lassez, 1987). Constraint Logic Programming was born. Today Constraint Programming is a separate subject independent of the underlying programming language, though constraint logic programming still plays a prominent role thanks to natural integration of constraints into a logic programming framework. This article presents mainstream techniques for solving constraint satisfaction problems. These techniques stay behind the existing constraint solvers and their understanding is important to exploit fully the available technology.",2661.0,190.07142857142856,True,['F'],"['University of California, Irvine']",[10605],[213],2,-1,0.0001219571609561,-1,1,0.102628365,0.6604292392730713,0.5460292100906372,0.5002480745315552,0.4347195923328399,0.5172585248947144,1.0,46.0,13.0,320.0,183,89.88333333333334,0.625,0.253125,1.90625,18.465750000000043

We aimed to investigate the burden and types of comorbidities in patients with hypertension and to assess how such comorbidities and other variables affect BP levels over time. Methods and findings In this multiple landmark cohort study, we used linked electronic health records from the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) to compare systolic blood pressure (SBP) levels in 295,487 patients (51% women) aged 61.5 (SD = 13.1) years with first recorded diagnosis of hypertension between 2000 and 2014, by type and numbers of major comorbidities, from at least 5 years before and up to 10 years after hypertension diagnosis. Time-updated multivariable linear regression analyses showed that the presence of more comorbidities was associated with lower SBP during follow-up. In hypertensive patients without comorbidities, mean SBP at diagnosis and at 10 years were 162.3 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI] 162.0 to 162.6) and 140.5 mm Hg (95% CI 140.4 to 140.6), respectively; in hypertensive patients with ≥5 comorbidities, these were 157.3 mm Hg (95% CI 156.9 to 157.6) and 136.8 mm Hg (95% 136.4 to 137.3), respectively. This inverse association between numbers of comorbidities and SBP was not specific to particular types of comorbidities, although associations were stronger in those with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Retrospective analysis of recorded SBP showed that the difference in mean SBP 5 years before diagnosis between those without and with ≥5 comorbidities was −9 mm Hg (95% CI −9.7 to −8.3), suggesting that mean recorded SBP already differed according to the presence of comorbidity before baseline. Within 1 year after the diagnosis, SBP substantially declined, but subsequent SBP changes across comorbidity status were modest, with no evidence of a more rapid decline in those with more or specific types of comorbidities. We identified factors, such as prescriptions of antihypertensive drugs and frequency of healthcare visits, that can explain SBP differences according to numbers or types of comorbidities, but these factors only partly explained the recorded SBP differences. Nevertheless, some limitations have to be considered including the possibility that diagnosis of some conditions may not have been recorded, varying degrees of missing data inherent in analytical datasets extracted from routine health records, and greater measurement errors in clinical measurements taken in routine practices than those taken in well-controlled clinical study settings. Conclusions BP levels at which patients were diagnosed with hypertension varied substantially according to the presence of comorbidities and were lowest in patients with multi-morbidity. Our findings suggest that this early selection bias of hypertension diagnosis at different BP levels was a key determinant of long-term differences in BP by comorbidity status. The lack of a more rapid decline in SBP in those with multi-morbidity provides some reassurance for BP treatment in these high-risk individuals.",1.0,0.5,False,"['F', 'F', 'M', '-', 'F', 'M', 'F', 'M', 'M', 'M']","[None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Unknown affiliation', 'Chief Scientist, AIG || Machine Learning & Biomedical Informatics, The University of Oxford', None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, 330, 8226, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, 20, 63, None, None]",14,-1,6.605214485464798e-05,-1,1,0.038404305,0.5807463526725769,0.4610857963562011,0.3930362164974212,0.3826910853385925,0.4431900382041931,1.0,69.0,16.0,487.0,235,92.84114052953156,0.639921722113503,0.2681017612524461,1.9823874755381603,1.0625195694716467

The book begins with a history of UML, from structured design methods of the '60s and '70s to the competing object-oriented design standards that were unified in 1997 to create UML. For the novice, the authors illustrate key diagram types such as class, use case, state machine, activity, and implementation. (Of course, learning these basic diagram types is what UML is all about. The authors use an easy-to-understand ticket-booking system for many of their examples.) After a tour of basic document types, The Unified Modeling Language Reference Manual provides an alphabetical listing of more than 350 UML terms. Entries range from a sentence or two to several pages in length. (Class, operation, and use case are just a few of the important terms that are covered.) Though you will certainly need to be acquainted with software engineering principles, this reference will serve the working software developer well.

However, their importance in cardiology services has not previously been clearly quantified. Between 1985 and 1993, we performed a prospective observational study to evaluate the importance of ADRs in patients admitted to a cardiology department. Of the 1023 patients studied, 11 (1.1%) had an adverse reaction at the time of hospitalisation and 132 (12.9%) had at least one ADR while hospitalised. Ten of 11 ADRs at the time of hospitalisation were the reason for hospitalisation. A total of 178 (2.6% of the 6801 prescriptions) adverse reactions were detected during hospitalisation. The most frequently encountered adverse reactions were nonspecific gastrointestinal problems (n = 34) and headache (n = 33). Digoxin was the drug most frequently implicated in patients hospitalised because of ADRs. Nitrates, calcium antagonists, β-adrenoceptor antagonists and digitalis compounds were the drug classes most frequently associated with ADRs during hospitalisation. The length of hospital stay was almost 5 days longer in patients who developed ADRs during hospitalisation than in those who did not. ADR patients consumed 2.5 more drugs than non-ADR patients. Thus, ADRs during, or leading to, hospitalisation in patients in cardiology departments are associated with important health and economic consequences.",1.0,0.037037037037037,False,"['-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-']","[None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None]",7,-1,5.8978344129884647e-05,-1,1,0.07450311,0.4756393432617188,0.5763030052185059,0.454395443201065,0.4367385506629944,0.4750248491764068,1.0,39.0,12.0,202.0,117,89.68085106382979,0.6153846153846154,0.2884615384615384,2.0384615384615383,17.329153846153872

More technically, this concern is related to the classical data integration problem, i.e. how to universally map information from heterogeneous data sources. Adoption of CM may become possible if collaborative agents can automatically discover a set of suitable CM services, and invoke them in a particular order to achieve a certain manufacturing task. Cloud computing community suggested semantic web services in order to enable automatic discovery, invocation and orchestration of web services. In this paper, we describe a novel multi-agent framework, where agents are configured based on Belief, Desire, and Intention (BDI) formalism. In this proposed framework, agents are capable of autonomously discovering and orchestrating manufacturing services based on their intrinsic and extrinsic awareness of the manufacturing knowledge at its most contemporary state. The internal structure of agents are constructed by Horn-DL rules, arguing such DL-safe rules will be able to extract and analyze manufacturing knowledge bases, built with OWL-DL.

The study extends the linear supply chain context to a complex supply network and undertakes a rigorous examination of robustness of these supply networks that are characterized by distinct network characteristics. We theorize that network characteristics such as average path length, clustering coefficient, size of the largest connected component in the network and the maximum distance between nodes in the largest connected component are related to the robustness of supply networks, and test the research hypotheses using data from several simulation runs. Simulations were carried out using twenty distinct network topologies where ten of these topologies were generated using preferential attachment approach (based on the theory of scale-free networks) and the remaining ten topologies were generated using random attachment approach (using random graph theory as a foundation). These twenty supply networks were subjected to random demand and their performances were evaluated by considering varying probabilities of random failures of nodes and targeted attacks on nodes. We also consider the severity of these disruptions by considering the downtime of the affected nodes. Using the data collected from a series of simulation experiments, we test the research hypotheses by means of binomial logistic regression analysis.

Predicting the effects of genetic modification is difficult due to the complexity of metabolic net- works. Various gene knockout strategies have been utilised to deactivate specific genes in order to determine the effects of these genes on the function of microbes. Deactivation of genes can lead to deletion of certain proteins and functions. Through these strategies, the associated function of a deleted gene can be identified from the metabolic networks.


METHODS
The main aim of this paper is to review the available techniques in gene knockout strategies for microbial cells. The review is done in terms of their methodology, recent applications in microbial cells. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques are compared and discuss and the related patents are also listed as well.


RESULTS
Traditionally, gene knockout is done through wet lab (in vivo) techniques, which were conducted through laboratory experiments. However, these techniques are costly and time consuming. Hence, various dry lab (in silico) techniques, where are conducted using computational approaches, have been developed to surmount these problem.


CONCLUSION
The development of numerous techniques for gene knockout in microbial cells has brought many advancements in the study of gene functions.

However, state-of-theart speaker recognition systems still rely on human engineering features such as mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCC). We believe that the handcrafted features limit the potential of the powerful representation of DNNs. Besides, there are also additional steps such as voice activity detection (VAD) and cepstral mean and variance normalization (CMVN) after computing the MFCC. In this paper, we show that MFCC, VAD, and CMVN can be replaced by the tools available in the standard deep learning toolboxes, such as a stacked of stride convolutions, temporal gating, and instance normalization. With these tools, we show that directly learning speaker embeddings from waveforms outperforms an x-vector network that uses MFCC or filter-bank output as features. We achieve an EER of 1.95% on the VoxCeleb1 test set using an end-to-end training scheme, which, to our best knowledge, is the best performance reported using raw waveforms. What’s more, the proposed method is complementary with x-vector systems.

However, tuning parameter choice and computational efficiency in ultra-high dimensional problems remain vexing issues. The routine use of $\ell_1$ regularization is largely attributable to the computational efficiency of the LARS algorithm, but similar efficiency for better behaved penalties has remained elusive. In this article, we propose a highly efficient path following procedure for combination of any convex loss function and a broad class of penalties. From a Bayesian perspective, this algorithm rapidly yields maximum a posteriori estimates at different hyper-parameter values. To bypass the inefficiency and potential instability of cross validation, we propose an empirical Bayes procedure for rapidly choosing the optimal model and corresponding hyper-parameter value. This approach applies to any penalty that corresponds to a proper prior distribution on the regression coefficients. While we mainly focus on sparse estimation of generalized linear models, the method extends to more general regularizations such as polynomial trend filtering after reparameterization.

Using a simulation model, I analyse (a) whether indirect reciprocity can lead to trust between two organisations even when many people are involved, when the extent of their indirect reciprocation differs, and when helping others is costly; and (b) how the presence of a boundary spanner affects this process. The main findings are that (a) indirect reciprocity can indeed create interorganisational trust under such conditions, and that, in fact, indirect may outperform direct reciprocity. Furthermore, (b) boundary spanners can decrease or increase interorganisational trust: they may decrease it by boosting their own trust at the expense of that of others, and they may increase it by enhancing indirect reciprocity for everyone through four mechanisms: contributing, discriminating, initiating and consolidating.",48.0,6.857142857142857,False,['-'],"['Associate Professor of Strategy, University College London']",[371],[8],11,-1,6.085040381870159e-05,1,-1,0.042993028,0.5575991868972778,0.5719127058982849,0.5267762541770935,0.3698880672454834,0.4847162067890167,1.0,33.0,5.0,169.0,98,90.36184210526316,0.5697674418604651,0.2674418604651162,2.0174418604651163,7.536418604651203

Dynamical downscaling of SINTEX-F2v forecasts using the WRF Model is found to further improve the skill scores over South Africa.

When the chemical potential is far away from the band edge, the Kondo temperature is independent of the spin-orbit coupling.

Here, we review the literature evaluating these conditions and provide suggestions for clinical decision-making. Acute tandem stenosis or occlusion of the common and internal carotid arteries may be treated with angioplasty alone, reserving carotid artery stenting (CAS) or CEA for severe and complex cases. Patients who underwent CEA and developed ipsilateral restenosis may be subjected to angioplasty followed by CAS, which carries a lower risk of cranial nerve injury and subsequent restenosis of the artery. For post-CAS restenosis, current evidence recommends angioplasty and CAS for the management of moderate stenosis and CEA for severe stenosis of the carotid artery. Given the lack of level 1 evidence for the management of these conditions, the abovementioned recommendations may assist clinical decision-making; however, each case and its unique risks and benefits need to be assessed individually.

Additionally, we demonstrate that in some instances, networks trained to copy bit-vectors of size 9 can be scaled to sizes of 1,000 without further training.

This type of wireless network is formed by mobile nodes without any existing infrastructure setup. The nodes in the MANET will require mutually exclusive identities before participating in any form of communication. In particular, each node in the network needs a unique address so that the data packets can be routed hop by hop and delivered ultimately to the destination. The routing protocols which are available in MANETs have all assumed a priori that mobile nodes are configured with a valid (conflict free) network address. Because of the multi-hop routing, the MAC address at the link layer level cannot serve for this purpose. On the other hand, address allocation schemes in wired networks, such as DHCP, needs a centralized DHCP server. It doesn't work well for MANETs due to the mobility of the nodes and the lack of a central authority. Address assignment is a key problem in ad hoc networks due to the lack of infrastructure. Autonomous addressing protocols need a distributed and self-managed mechanism in order to avoid address collisions in a dynamic network with fading channels, frequent partitions, and joining/leaving nodes. There have been several approaches proposed for the dynamic addressing scheme.

Methods: A retrospective, cross-sectional analysis was performed using data from the 2003 to 2014 National Inpatient Sample. Palliative care was identified through International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code V66.7. Demographics, comorbidities, hospital characteristics, tumor-related, and treatment-related factors were compared between patients with and without PC. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore predictors of PC use. Results: Among 131 852 patients with MBC, 13 224 (10.03%) received PC. Rate of PC increased from 2.49% in 2003 to 28.39% in 2014 (P < .0001). Similarly, rate of PC in decedents increased from 7.02% in 2003 to 54.86% in 2014 (P < .0001). Patients receiving PC were older, tendered to be white, had more comorbidities, and higher all-patient refined diagnosis-related group mortality risk. Predictors of PC included age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01-1.02; P < .0001), Medicaid (OR: 1.87; 95%.CI: 1.54-2.26; P < .0001), and private (OR: 1.61; 95% CI: 1.40-1.84; P < .0001) insurance, hospitals in the West (OR: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.10-1.61; P = .0032), and Mid-west (OR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.22-1.75; P = .0032), major (OR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.11-1.49; P < .0001), and extreme (OR: 2.37; 95% CI: 2.04-2.76; P < .0001) mortality risk.

Immunol.,"Tolerogenic cell therapies provide an alternative to conventional immunosuppressive treatments of autoimmune disease and address, among other goals, the rejection of organ or stem cell transplants. Since various methodologies can be followed to develop tolerogenic therapies, it is important to be aware and up to date on all available studies that may be relevant to their improvement. Recently, knowledge graphs have been proposed to link various sources of information, using text mining techniques. Knowledge graphs facilitate the automatic retrieval of information about the topics represented in the graph. The objective of this work was to automatically generate a knowledge graph for tolerogenic cell therapy from biomedical literature. We developed a system, ICRel, based on machine learning to extract relations between cells and cytokines from abstracts. Our system retrieves related documents from PubMed, annotates each abstract with cell and cytokine named entities, generates the possible combinations of cell–cytokine pairs cooccurring in the same sentence, and identifies meaningful relations between cells and cytokines. The extracted relations were used to generate a knowledge graph, where each edge was supported by one or more documents. We obtained a graph containing 647 cell–cytokine relations, based on 3,264 abstracts. The modules of ICRel were evaluated with cross-validation and manual evaluation of the relations extracted. The relation extraction module obtained an F-measure of 0.789 in a reference database, while the manual evaluation obtained an accuracy of 0.615. Even though the knowledge graph is based on information that was already published in other articles about immunology, the system we present is more efficient than the laborious task of manually reading all the literature to find indirect or implicit relations. The ICRel graph will help experts identify implicit relations that may not be evident in published studies.",12.0,2.0,False,"['-', '-', '-', '-']","['Aalborg University', None, None, None]","[118, None, None, None]","[14, None, None, None]",9,-1,6.709224499600876e-05,-1,1,0.11784716,0.4835253059864044,0.5953513979911804,0.4873311817646026,0.3726667463779449,0.3980672359466553,1.0,29.0,13.0,288.0,167,92.4,0.6067796610169491,0.3525423728813559,2.088135593220339,7.645728813559373

Then, limited penetrable visibility graph (LPVG) and its degree sequence are employed to implement the preliminary feature extraction. All these features are finally fed into a BLS to study and classify the SSVEP and SSMVEP signals, respectively. The classification results show that our LPVG-based BLS can effectively classify VEP-based EEG signals, with average classification accuracy 96.22% for SSVEP and 74.54% for SSMVEP.

Spiral acquisition trajectories have been shown to be superior to currently prevalent echo‐planar imaging in terms of acquisition efficiency, and high spatial resolution can be achieved by employing multiple‐shot spiral acquisition. The interleaved spiral in/out trajectory is preferred over spiral‐in due to increased BOLD signal contrast‐to‐noise ratio (CNR) and higher acquisition efficiency than that of spiral‐out or noninterleaved spiral in/out trajectories (Law & Glover. Magn Reson Med 2009; 62:829–834.), but to date applicability of the multishot interleaved spiral in/out for high spatial resolution imaging has not been studied. Herein we propose multishot interleaved spiral in/out acquisition and investigate its applicability for high spatial resolution BOLD functional magnetic resonance imaging. Images reconstructed from interleaved spiral‐in and ‐out trajectories possess artifacts caused by differences in T2* decay, off‐resonance, and k‐space errors associated with the two trajectories. We analyze the associated errors and demonstrate that application of conjugate phase reconstruction and spectral filtering can substantially mitigate these image artifacts. After applying these processing steps, the multishot interleaved spiral in/out pulse sequence yields high BOLD CNR images at in‐plane resolution below 1 × 1 mm while preserving acceptable temporal resolution (4 s) and brain coverage (15 slices of 2 mm thickness). Moreover, this method yields sufficient BOLD CNR at 1.5 mm isotropic resolution for detection of activation in hippocampus associated with cognitive tasks (Stern memory task). The multishot interleaved spiral in/out acquisition is a promising technique for high spatial resolution BOLD functional magnetic resonance imaging applications.

One of these models is the continuous-time random-walk (CTRW) model, which introduces two new parameters: a fractional order time derivative α and a fractional order spatial derivative β. These new parameters have been linked to intravoxel diffusion heterogeneities in time and space, respectively, and are believed to depend on diffusion times. Studies on this time dependency are limited, largely because the diffusion time cannot vary over a board range in a conventional spin-echo echo-planar imaging sequence due to the accompanying T2 decays. In this study, we investigated the time-dependency of the CTRW model in Sephadex gel phantoms across a broad diffusion time range by employing oscillating-gradient spin-echo, pulsed-gradient spin-echo, and pulsed-gradient stimulated echo sequences. We also performed Monte Carlo simulations to help understand our experimental results.

We investigated the mechanisms underlying multimorbidity between three main allergic diseases at a molecular level by identifying the proteins and cellular processes that are common to them. Methods An in silico study based on computational analysis of the topology of the protein interaction network was performed in order to characterize the molecular mechanisms of multimorbidity of asthma, eczema and rhinitis. As a first step, proteins associated to either disease were identified using data mining approaches, and their overlap was calculated. Secondly, a functional interaction network was built, allowing to identify cellular pathways involved in allergic multimorbidity. Finally, a network-based algorithm generated a ranked list of newly predicted multimorbidity-associated proteins. Results Asthma, eczema and rhinitis shared a larger number of associated proteins than expected by chance, and their associated proteins exhibited a significant degree of interconnectedness in the interaction network. There were 15 pathways involved in the multimorbidity of asthma, eczema and rhinitis, including IL4 signaling and GATA3-related pathways. A number of proteins potentially associated to these multimorbidity processes were also obtained. Conclusions These results strongly support the existence of an allergic multimorbidity cluster between asthma, eczema and rhinitis, and suggest that type 2 signaling pathways represent a relevant multimorbidity mechanism of allergic diseases. Furthermore, we identified new candidates contributing to multimorbidity that may assist in identifying new targets for multimorbid allergic diseases.",32.0,5.333333333333333,False,"['M', 'F', '-', 'M', '-', '-', '-', 'M', '-', 'F', 'F', '-', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'F', 'M', '-']","[None, None, None, 'VIB - Ghent University', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, 8226, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, 152, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",10,-1,7.543320946723968e-05,-1,1,0.12050098,0.5263468623161316,0.688664972782135,0.5211790204048157,0.3887503445148468,0.3940306007862091,1.0,31.0,14.0,238.0,123,92.63513513513512,0.6570247933884298,0.3884297520661157,2.31404958677686,-10.857595041322298

We are interested in the fact that the relevance and the trustworthiness of the information acquired by an agent X from a source F, strictly depends and derives from the X's trust in F with respect the kind of that information. Even if, of course, we have also to consider the potential (positive and negative) interferences between this information and the previous X's beliefs. In this paper, we analyze the different dimensions of trust in information sources and formalize the degree of subjective certainty or strength of the X's belief P, considering three main factors: the X's trust about P just depending from the X's judgement of the source's competence and reliability; the sources' degree of certainty about P; and the X's degree of trust that P derives from that given source. Finally we present a computational approach based on fuzzy sets and some interesting examples of significant cases. 1 Premise In our perspective [Castelfranchi and Falcone, 2010; Castelfranchi et al, 2003] trust in information sources is just a kind of social trust, preserving all its prototypical properties and dimensions; just adding new important features and dynamics. In particular, also the trust in information sources [Demolombe, 1999] can just be an evaluation, judgment and feeling, or be a decision to rely on, and act of believing in and to the trustee (Y) and rely on it. Also this trust and the perceived trustworthiness of Y, has two main dimensions: the ascribed competence versus the ascribed willingness (intentions, persistence, reliability, honesty, sincerity, etc.). Also this form of trust is not empty, without a, more or less specified, object/argument: "" X trusts Y "" ! As we have shown, trust is for/about something, it has an object: what X expects from Y; Y's service, action, provided good.

We have generated an array of temperature-sensitive yeast exo84 mutants. Electron microscopy and cargo protein traffic analyses of these mutants indicated that Exo84p is specifically involved in the post-Golgi stage of secretion. Using various yeast mutants, we systematically studied the localization of Exo84p and other exocyst proteins by fluorescence microscopy. We found that pre-Golgi traffic and polarized actin organization are required for Exo84p localization. However, none of the exocyst proteins controls Exo84p polarization. In addition, Sec3p is not responsible for the polarization of Exo84p or any other exocyst component to the daughter cell. On the other hand, several exocyst members, including Sec10p, Sec15p, and Exo70p, clearly require Exo84p for their polarization. Biochemical analyses of the exocyst composition indicated that the assembly of Sec10p, Sec15p, and Exo70p with the rest of the complex requires Exo84p. We propose that there are at least two distinct regulatory mechanisms for exocyst polarization, one for Sec3p and one for the other members, including Exo84p.

Prognostic frameworks inherently presume that there is predictability in the failure rate of the system, i.e. a system experiencing exclusively stochastic failure events cannot, by definition, be predictable. Prediction model uncertainties must be bound in some logical way. Therefore, to achieve an accurate prognostic model, uncertainty must first be reduced through the identification and elimination of the root causes of random failure events. This research investigates human error in maintenance activities as a major cause of random failure events, using a case study from the biopharmaceutical industry. Elastomer failures remain the number one contamination risk in this industry and data shows unexplained variability in the lifetime of real components when compared to accelerated lifetime testing in the lab environment. Technician error during installation and maintenance activities of elastomers is one possible cause for this and this research explores how these errors can be eliminated, reduced, or accounted for within the reliability modeling process. The initial approach followed was to improve technician training in order to reduce errors and thereby reduce the variability of random failure events. Subsequent data has shown an improvement in key metrics with failures now more closely matching data from lab testing. However, there is scope for further improvements and future research will explore the role of performance influencing factors in the maintenance task to identify additional causes of variation. These factors may then be incorporated as a process variable in a prognostics and health management (PHM) model developed for the system. The paper will present these data fusion approaches accounting for human factors as a roadmap to improving PHM model reliability.",4.0,0.5,False,"['M', 'F', 'M', '-']","[None, None, 'Politecnico di Milano', None]","[None, None, 1375, None]","[None, None, 176, None]",17,-1,0.0002098830882031,-1,-1,0.055532172,0.5019455552101135,0.6385453939437866,0.5320720672607422,0.4340345859527588,0.419474333524704,1.0,28.0,13.0,287.0,166,92.94444444444444,0.6206896551724138,0.3241379310344827,2.113793103448276,3.749603448275877

The algorithm employs points of maximum curvature, extracted from laser scan data, as point landmarks in an extended Kalman filter. A curvature scale space algorithm is developed to locate points of maximum curvature. The location of these points is invariant to view-point and sensor resolution. They can therefore be used as stable and reliable landmarks in a localization algorithm. This information is then fused with odometric information to provide localization information for an outdoor vehicle. The method described is invariant to the size and orientation of the range images under consideration (with respect to rotation and translation), is robust to noise, and can reliably detect and localize naturally occurring landmarks in the operating environment. The method developed is generally applicable to a range of unstructured environments and may be used with different types of sensors. The method is demonstrated as part of a navigation system for an outdoor vehicle in an unmodified operating domain.",85.0,4.473684210526316,False,"['-', '-']","[None, 'University of Sydney']","[None, None]","[None, 289]",5,-1,5.806402274861045e-05,-1,-1,0.121650025,0.3622523248195648,0.642578661441803,0.3922697305679321,0.3958021402359009,0.4095017313957214,1.0,16.0,10.0,171.0,94,91.64473684210526,0.5930232558139535,0.3488372093023256,2.116279069767442,8.512790697674433

By formulating sequential search as reinforcement learning of the search policy (including the stopping condition), our fully trainable model can explicitly balance for each class, specifically, the conflicting goals of exploration - sampling more image regions for better accuracy -, and exploitation - stopping the search efficiently when sufficiently confident about the target's location.

We introduce Mi3-GPU (""mee-three"", for MCMC Inverse Ising Inference) software for solving the inverse Ising problem for protein-sequence datasets with few analytic approximations, by parallel Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo sampling on GPUs. We also provide tools for analysis and preparation of protein-family Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs) to account for finite-sampling issues, which are a major source of error or bias in inverse Ising inference. Our method is ""generative"" in the sense that the inferred model can be used to generate synthetic MSAs whose mutational statistics (marginals) can be verified to match the dataset MSA statistics up to the limits imposed by the effects of finite sampling. Our GPU implementation enables the construction of models which reproduce the covariation patterns of the observed MSA with a precision that is not possible with more approximate methods. The main components of our method are a GPU-optimized algorithm to greatly accelerate MCMC sampling, combined with a multi-step Quasi-Newton parameter-update scheme using a ""Zwanzig reweighting"" technique.

To establish a simple and accurate method for rapid detection of lamivudine related mutations in hepatitis B virus (HBV) polymerase gene.


METHODS
HBV polymerase gene fragments of covering B and C active region were amplified by nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) or nested mismatched PCR. The PCR products were digested with Nde I or Nia III and subjected to electrophoresis on agarose gel, respectively. The patterns of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) were distinguished. Using this method, thirty patients with chronic hepatitis B and treated with lamivudine for at least one year were analysed for the lamivudine related mutations in polymerase gene. Sixteen cases without lamivudine therapy were used as controls. Some of the patients were also analysed by clone sequencing.


RESULTS
The nested mismatched PCR-RFLP method was simple, accurate and rapid. The whole experiments could be finished in eleven hours. The least titers of HBV DNA which could be detected was 10.3 copies/ml. The wild or mutant strains judged by RFLP were identified by clone sequencing. Mutation in the tyrosine methionine aspartic aspartic acid (YMDD) motif of HBV polymerase gene was found in eight patients and mutations of YMDD motif associated with L526M were found in another three patients. However, there were no such mutations in the control cases.

BVES was found to be underexpressed in all stages of human colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and in adenomatous polyps, indicating its suppression occurs early in transformation. Similarly, the majority of CRC cell lines tested exhibited decreased BVES expression and promoter DNA hypermethylation, a modification associated with transcriptional silencing. Treatment with a DNA-demethylating agent restored BVES expression in CRC cell lines, indicating that methylation represses BVES expression. Reexpression of BVES in CRC cell lines promoted an epithelial phenotype, featuring decreased proliferation, migration, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth; impaired growth of an orthotopic xenograft; and blocked metastasis. Conversely, interfering with BVES function by expressing a dominant-negative mutant in human corneal epithelial cells induced mesenchymal features. These biological outcomes were associated with changes in AJ and TJ composition and related signaling.

Motivated by these facts, an active learning model based on multi-criteria decision making (MCMD) is proposed in this paper. After the investigation between any two unlabeled samples, a preference preorder is determined for each criterion.

Multiple-instance active learning (MIAL) aims to select and label the most informative bags from numerous unlabeled ones, and learn a MIL classifier for accurately predicting unseen bags by requesting as few labels as possible.

In 2013, Ioffe et al. pointed out that there is a serious problem in the training process of deep neural network, i.e., internal covariate shift. It slows down the training for requiring careful parameter initialization and smaller learning rate. Ioffe et al. put forward batch normalization (BN) to reduce the effect of internal covariate shift, to accelerate the convergence speed of training neural networks. At present, many networks use BN as an important approach to accelerate training. In view of the application value of BN, this paper systematically reviews the research progress of BN and its related algorithms. Firstly, the theory of BN is analyzed. Although BN is simple and helpful, there are also some problems, such as relying on the size of mini-batch, training and inference process are in different ways. Therefore, many scholars have proposed a variety of algorithms based on BN, the advantages and main function of those algorithms are analyzed and summarized.

for solving non-convex optimization problems in machine learning. These methods
primarily rely on the gradient of the loss function to estimate descent direction.
However, they have a number of drawbacks, including converging to saddle points
(as opposed to minima), slow convergence, and sensitivity to parameter tuning. In
contrast, second order methods that use curvature information in addition to the
gradient, have been shown to achieve faster convergence rates, theoretically. When
used in the context of machine learning applications, they offer faster (quadratic)
convergence, stability to parameter tuning, and robustness to problem conditioning.
In spite of these advantages, first order methods are commonly used because of their
simplicity of implementation and low per-iteration cost. The need to generate and
use curvature information in the form of a dense Hessian matrix makes each iteration
of second order methods more expensive.

 In this work, we address three key problems associated with second order methods
– (i) what is the best way to incorporate curvature information into the optimization
procedure; (ii) how do we reduce the operation count of each iteration in a second order method, while maintaining its superior convergence property; and (iii) how do we
leverage high-performance computing platforms to significant accelerate second order
methods. To answer the first question, we propose and validate the use of Fisher
information matrices in second order methods to significantly accelerate convergence.
The second question is answered through the use of statistical sampling techniques
that suitably sample matrices to reduce per-iteration cost without impacting convergence. The third question is addressed through the use of graphics processing units
(GPUs) in distributed platforms to deliver state of the art solvers.
 Through our work, we show that our solvers are capable of significant improvement
over state of the art optimization techniques for training machine learning models.

However, the great number of public transport companies operating in the same area can sometimes confuse travellers as to which route they should take and how to obtain the information relative to their journey. In this paper we suggest integrating several traveller information systems from different companies into the same multimodal information system, offering companies the choice not to share their data. This encourages them to join the system. Additionally, we have minimised the number of nodes involved when processing travellers’ requests in order to simplify the calculation process. To put our plan into action, we have opted for a multi-agent system coupled with the Voronoi decomposition for managing the network.",1.0,0.1111111111111111,False,"['M', 'M']","[None, ""Professeur d'université, Université Oran1 Ahmed BenBella""]","[None, 68]","[None, 38]",18,-1,5.518923229906055e-05,-1,-1,0.039617825,0.6817684769630432,0.5255838632583618,0.4889371693134308,0.5091066360473633,0.4680982828140259,0.0,12.0,8.0,131.0,89,92.45535714285714,0.5833333333333334,0.2727272727272727,2.0,18.654500000000013

When walking with a 30 kg load, allowing the load to swing reduces the fore-aft leg impulses by over 19% and further reduces the mechanical energy of the stance leg by 12.9% compared to the typical rigid backpack. The whole-body metabolic cost has no significant change, which may be attributed to the increase in the muscle work of the upper body and the leg swing. Moreover, the load movement out of phase to the human in the lateral direction reduces the lateral excursion of extrapolated center-of-mass by 27.2%, indicating an increase in the lateral margin of stability and implying an improvement in lateral stability.

Feature subset selection is basically an optimization problem for choosing the most important features from various alternatives in order to facilitate classification or mining problems. Though lots of algorithms have been developed so far, none is considered to be the best for all situations and researchers are still trying to come up with better solutions. In this work, a flexible and user-guided feature subset selection algorithm, named as FCTFS (Feature Cluster Taxonomy based Feature Selection) has been proposed for selecting suitable feature subset from a large feature set. The proposed algorithm falls under the genre of clustering based feature selection techniques in which features are initially clustered according to their intrinsic characteristics following the filter approach. In the second step the most suitable feature is selected from each cluster to form the final subset following a wrapper approach. The two stage hybrid process lowers the computational cost of subset selection, especially for large feature data sets. One of the main novelty of the proposed approach lies in the process of determining optimal number of feature clusters. Unlike currently available methods, which mostly employ a trial and error approach, the proposed method characterises and quantifies the feature clusters according to the quality of the features inside the clusters and defines a taxonomy of the feature clusters. The selection of individual features from a feature cluster can be done judiciously considering both the relevancy and redundancy according to users intention and requirement. The algorithm has been verified by simulation experiments with different bench mark data set containing features ranging from 10 to more than 800 and compared with other currently used feature selection algorithms. The simulation results prove the superiority of our proposal in terms of model performance, flexibility of use in practical problems and extendibility to large feature sets.

It is entirely based on a multi-dimensional Particle Swarm Optimization (MD PSO) technique, which re-forms the native structure of swarm particles in such a way that they can make inter-dimensional passes with a dedicated dimensional PSO process. Therefore, in a multidimensional search space where the optimum dimension is unknown, swarm particles can seek both positional and dimensional optima. This eventually removes the necessity of setting a fixed dimension a priori, which is a common drawback for the family of swarm optimizers. With the proper encoding of the network configurations and parameters into particles, MD PSO can then seek the positional optimum in the error space and the dimensional optimum in the architecture space. The optimum dimension converged at the end of a MD PSO process corresponds to a unique ANN configuration where the network parameters (connections, weights and biases) can then be resolved from the positional optimum reached on that dimension. In addition to this, the proposed technique generates a ranked list of network configurations, from the best to the worst. This is indeed a crucial piece of information, indicating what potential configurations can be alternatives to the best one, and which configurations should not be used at all for a particular problem. In this study, the architecture space is defined over feed-forward, fully-connected ANNs so as to use the conventional techniques such as back-propagation and some other evolutionary methods in this field. The proposed technique is applied over the most challenging synthetic problems to test its optimality on evolving networks and over the benchmark problems to test its generalization capability as well as to make comparative evaluations with the several competing techniques. The experimental results show that the MD PSO evolves to optimum or near-optimum networks in general and has a superior generalization capability. Furthermore, the MD PSO naturally favors a low-dimension solution when it exhibits a competitive performance with a high dimension counterpart and such a native tendency eventually yields the evolution process to the compact network configurations in the architecture space rather than the complex ones, as long as the optimality prevails.",284.0,20.285714285714285,True,"['M', '-', 'M', 'M']","[None, 'Izmir University of Economics, Department of Electrical & Electronics Engineering', None, 'Professor, Tampere University']","[None, 149, None, 4459]","[None, 14, None, 590]",9,-1,6.631064849748856e-05,-1,-1,0.030677842,0.5894935727119446,0.7217646241188049,0.5547215938568115,0.410021960735321,0.4621226489543915,1.0,42.0,12.0,373.0,186,90.78729281767956,0.5549738219895288,0.2879581151832461,1.973821989528796,8.283159685863893

Different from existing surrogate models adopting stationary covariance functions (kernels) to measure the difference between hyperparameter points, this article proposes a nonstationary kernel that allows the surrogate model to adapt to functions whose smoothness varies with the spatial location of inputs. A multilevel convolutional neural network (ML-CNN) is built for lung nodule classification, and the hyperparameter configuration is optimized by the proposed nonstationary kernel-based Gaussian surrogate model. Our algorithm searches with a surrogate for optimal setting via a hyperparameter importance-based evolutionary strategy, and the experiments demonstrate our algorithm outperforms manual tuning and several well-established hyperparameter optimization methods, including random search, grid search, the tree-structured parzen estimator (TPE) approach, Gaussian processes (GP) with stationary kernels, and the recently proposed hyperparameter optimization via RBF and dynamic (HORD) coordinate search.",6.0,3.0,False,"['-', '-', '-', 'M', 'M', 'M']","['Assistant Professor, Aalborg University', None, 'ARC Future Fellow, Monash University', None, None, None]","[434, None, 7310, None, None, None]","[21, None, 112, None, None, None]",14,-1,0.0001141223854434,-1,-1,0.12851201,0.5622118711471558,0.5460048317909241,0.5686602592468262,0.3468608558177948,0.5012639760971069,1.0,32.0,5.0,182.0,110,93.63905325443788,0.7301587301587301,0.4074074074074074,2.502645502645503,-41.834809523809525

Three consecutive blood samples were collected from each patient: before the start, 2 weeks after the start, and 4–6 weeks after the end of radiotherapy. The low-molecular-weight fraction of the serum proteome (2,000–13,000 Da) was analyzed by the MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry. Proteome profiles of serum samples collected before the start of radiotherapy and during the early stage of the treatment were similar.

Res.,"Optimisation algorithms with good anytime behaviour try to return as high-quality solutions as possible independently of the computation time allowed. Designing algorithms with good anytime behaviour is a difficult task, because performance is often evaluated subjectively, by plotting the trade-off curve between computation time and solution quality. Yet, the trade-off curve may be modelled also as a set of mutually nondominated, bi-objective points. Using this model, we propose to combine an automatic configuration tool and the hypervolume measure, which assigns a single quality measure to a nondominated set. This allows us to improve the anytime behaviour of optimisation algorithms by means of automatically finding algorithmic configurations that produce the best nondominated sets. Moreover, the recently proposed weighted hypervolume measure is used here to incorporate the decision-maker’s preferences into the automatic tuning procedure. We report on the improvements reached when applying the proposed method to two relevant scenarios: (i) the design of parameter variation strategies for MAX-MIN Ant System and (ii) the tuning of the anytime behaviour of SCIP, an open-source mixed integer programming solver with more than 200 parameters.",74.0,8.222222222222221,False,"['M', 'M']","['University of Málaga, Spain /// Alliance Manchester Business School, University of Manchester, UK', None]","[1144, None]","[69, None]",8,-1,6.502816785764434e-05,-1,1,0.0762676,0.5672183036804199,0.5514774322509766,0.4278735220432281,0.4543402791023254,0.3678452372550964,1.0,27.0,7.0,179.0,122,92.54491017964072,0.6417112299465241,0.3582887700534759,2.165775401069519,-2.373598930481279

Track 1 of the 2018 National NLP Clinical Challenges shared tasks focused on identifying which patients in a corpus of longitudinal medical records meet and do not meet identified selection criteria.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
To address this challenge, we annotated American English clinical narratives for 288 patients according to whether they met these criteria. We chose criteria from existing clinical trials that represented a variety of natural language processing tasks, including concept extraction, temporal reasoning, and inference.


RESULTS
A total of 47 teams participated in this shared task, with 224 participants in total. The participants represented 18 countries, and the teams submitted 109 total system outputs. The best-performing system achieved a micro F1 score of 0.91 using a rule-based approach. The top 10 teams used rule-based and hybrid systems to approach the problems.


DISCUSSION
Clinical narratives are open to interpretation, particularly in cases where the selection criterion may be underspecified. This leaves room for annotators to use domain knowledge and intuition in selecting patients, which may lead to error in system outputs. However, teams who consulted medical professionals while building their systems were more likely to have high recall for patients, which is preferable for patient selection systems.


CONCLUSIONS
There is not yet a 1-size-fits-all solution for natural language processing systems approaching this task. Future research in this area can look to examining criteria requiring even more complex inferences, temporal reasoning, and domain knowledge.",31.0,7.75,False,"['F', 'F', 'M', 'M', '-']","[None, 'Prometeia, CSAIL at MIT', 'The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston', 'Christopher Newport University', None]","[None, 482, 308, 234, None]","[None, 27, 25, 13, None]",12,1,5.69410268348324e-05,-1,1,0.06607135,0.4360202550888061,0.6463685035705566,0.4308131039142608,0.4095492959022522,0.4590892195701599,0.0,1.6666666666666667,0.9444444444444444,13.055555555555555,152,92.9054054054054,0.6735537190082644,0.3016528925619834,1.991735537190083,8.493173553719032

Three datasets are used to quantify fracture density, orientation, and fill in the foliated hanging wall of the Alpine Fault: (1) X-ray computed tomography (CT) images of drill core collected within 25 m of its principal slip zones (PSZs) during the first phase of the Deep Fault Drilling Project that were reoriented with respect to borehole televiewer images, (2) field measurements from creek sections up to 500 m from the PSZs, and (3) CT images of oriented drill core collected during the Amethyst Hydro Project at distances of  ∼  0.7–2 km from the PSZs. Results show that within 160 m of the PSZs in foliated cataclasites and ultramylonites, gouge-filled fractures exhibit a wide range of orientations. At these distances, fractures are interpreted to have formed at relatively high confining pressures and/or in rocks that had a weak mechanical anisotropy. Conversely, at distances greater than 160 m from the PSZs, fractures are typically open and subparallel to the mylonitic or schistose foliation, implying that fracturing occurred at low confining pressures and/or in rocks that were mechanically anisotropic. Fracture density is similar across the  ∼  500 m width of the field transects. By combining our datasets with measurements of permeability and seismic velocity around the Alpine Fault, we further develop the hierarchical model for hanging-wall damage structure that was proposed by Townend et al. (2017). The wider zone of foliation-parallel fractures represents an outer damage zone that forms at shallow depths. The distinct inner damage zone. This zone is interpreted to extend towards the base of the seismogenic crust given that its width is comparable to (1) the Alpine Fault low-velocity zone detected by fault zone guided waves and (2) damage zones reported from other exhumed large-displacement faults. In summary, a narrow zone of fracturing at the base of the Alpine Fault's hanging-wall seismogenic crust is anticipated to widen at shallow depths, which is consistent with fault zone flower structure models.",14.0,2.333333333333333,False,"['-', '-', '-', '-', '-', 'M']","[None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None]",17,-1,5.716387497308454e-05,-1,1,0.056094706,0.3295992314815521,0.5358141660690308,0.3111347258090973,0.380567729473114,0.4527798891067505,1.0,48.0,11.0,320.0,173,93.1774193548387,0.6272727272727273,0.2666666666666666,1.8727272727272728,15.92227272727274

Yet the microscopic size and highly specular and textureless nature of the surfaces make the task difficult. It is also demanded that the size of the entire inspection system be small so as to minimize restraint on the operation of the various moving parts involved in the manufacturing process. In this paper, we describe a new 3-D reconstruction mechanism for the task. The mechanism is based upon the well-known concept of structured-light projection, but adapted to a new configuration that owns a particularly small system size and operates in a different manner. Unlike the traditional mechanisms which involve an array of light sources that occupy a rather extended physical space, the proposed mechanism consists of only a single light source plus a binary grating for projecting binary pattern. To allow the projection at each position of the inspected surface to vary and form distinct binary code, the binary grating is shifted in space.

Decision trees exhibit better interpretability and expressive power due to their representation language and the existence of efficient algorithms to generate rules. Growing a decision tree based on the available data could produce larger than necessary trees or trees that do not generalise well. In this paper, we introduce two novel multivariate decision tree (MDT) algorithms for rule extraction from a DNN: an Exact-Convertible Decision Tree (EC-DT) and a Deep C-Net algorithm to transform a neural network with Rectified Linear Unit activation functions into a representative tree which can be used to extract multivariate rules for reasoning. While the EC-DT translates the DNN in a layer-wise manner to represent exactly the decision boundaries implicitly learned by the hidden layers of the network, the Deep C-Net inherits the decompositional approach from EC-DT and combines with a C5 tree learning algorithm to construct the decision rules. The results suggest that while EC-DT is superior in preserving the structure and the accuracy of DNN, C-Net generates the most compact and highly effective trees from DNN. Both proposed MDT algorithms generate rules including combinations of multiple attributes for precise interpretation of decision-making processes.",3.0,1.0,False,"['-', '-', '-']","[None, None, 'Fellow IEEE, Founding-Editor-in-Chief, IEEE Trans on AI, Professor, University of New South Wales']","[None, None, 9317]","[None, None, 452]",14,-1,6.528266429522448e-05,-1,1,0.04166185,0.737148106098175,0.5473952889442444,0.6098570823669434,0.4700757265090942,0.5816183686256409,1.0,32.0,8.0,223.0,143,93.0,0.6553191489361702,0.2851063829787234,1.9531914893617024,13.276500000000029

A Cultural Algorithm consists of a Belief Space consisting of a network of active and passive knowledge sources and a Population Space of agents. The agents are connected via a social fabric over which information used in agent problem solving is passed. The knowledge sources in the Belief Space compete with each other in order to influence the decision making of agents in the Population Space. Likewise, the problem solving experiences of agents in the Population Space are sent back to the Belief Space and used to update the knowledge sources there. It is a dual inheritance system in which both the Population and Belief spaces evolve in parallel. In this paper we compare three different social fabrics (homogeneous, heterogeneous and Sub-Cultures) over a wide range of problem complexities. The performances of these three different evolutionary approaches are compared relative to a variety of benchmark landscapes of varying entropy, from static to chaotic. We show that as the number of independent processes that are involved in the production of a landscape increases, the more advantageous subcultures are in directing the population to a solution. Such landscapes are often characteristic of deep learning problems in which patterns are generated by the interaction of many simple interactions. While sub-cultured approaches can emerge in a given problem, they do not have to.

The present study is aimed at bringing out the information on the effect of berberine chloride in hyper and hypo thyroidal model with two dose levels.


OBJECTIVE
The research article also reviewed details of various existing patents associated with comprehensive compilation regarding the therapeutic application of berberine and related forms.


METHOD
Sixty female wistar rats weighing between 150-250 gm were divided in to 10 groups. The animals were grouped in to solvent control; hypothyroid; hyperthyroid; prophylactic with two different doses of berberine chloride (50 and 100 mg/kg); treatment groups similar to that of the prophylactic and therapeutic group. To substantiate the dose dependent effect of berberine chloride in 6-n-propyL-2-thiouracil (PTU) induced hypothyroidism, lipid profile, thyroid profile, enzymes profiles and blood profiles, in addition to histopathological studies were also carried out. There was no any significant difference in the lipid profile among solvent control, treatment and prophylactic groups. However, there was a significant difference (***p<0.001) in serum triglycerides, LDL and VLDL of hypothyroid group when compound to that of the rest.

As far as thyroid profile is concerned, T3 level of berberine chloride (50 mg/kg) treated groups (prophylactic+ treatment) showed a significant rise compared to hypothyroid group. TSH level in prophylactic groups was far higher than the rest of the groups (3.002±0.0192, 1.051±0.0008 against the solvent control, 0.308±0.008). SGOT, SGPT levels were significantly higher with the therapeutic group than that of the normal and hypo-thyroidal group. Blood profile of berberine chloride (100 mg/kg) treated therapeutic group was comparable to that of the solvent control than all other groups. The probable mechanism underlying may be that inactivation of type I 5.-iodothyronine deiodinase (5.DI) enzyme by NF-kB pathway.


CONCLUSION
From the findings of the current study it can be concluded that berberine chloride possesses both thyroid stimulating and suppressing activities depending on its dose, especially berberine chloride 50 mg/kg supports thyroid stimulating property.",12.0,1.7142857142857142,False,"['-', 'F', 'M', 'M']","[None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None]",20,-1,0.8446013635842063,-1,1,0.059014816,0.3536481559276581,0.4776330590248108,0.3295412361621856,0.3661272823810577,0.3476627171039581,0.2222222222222222,3.2222222222222223,1.0,17.333333333333332,176,93.0379746835443,0.6755952380952381,0.2738095238095238,1.970238095238096,4.932357142857171

It has been thought that only model-based algorithms could perform goal-directed actions, optimally adapting to new reward struc- tures in the environment. In this work, we develop a new model-free algorithm capable of learning about many different tasks simultaneously, and mixing these together to perform novel, never-before-seen tasks. Our algorithm has the crucial property that, when performing a blend of previously learned tasks, it provably performs optimally. The algorithm learns a distributed representation of tasks, thereby avoiding the curse of dimensionality afflicting other hierarchical reinforcement learning ap- proaches like the options framework that cannot blend subtasks.

Networks,"AbstractIn recent research, link stability is getting tremendous attention in mobile adhoc networks (MANETs),
 because of several impediments that occur in a reliable and robust network. Link stability metric is used to improve network performance in terms of end-to-end delay, data success delivery ratio (DSDR) and available route time (ART). Energy consumption, bandwidth and communication delay of major concern in ad hoc networks. A high mobility of MANET nodes reduces the reliability of network communication. In a dynamic networks, high mobility of the nodes makes it very difficult to predict the dynamic routing topology and hence cause route/link failures. Multicast in MANETs is an emerging trend that effectively improves the performance while lowering the energy consumption and bandwidth usage. Multicast routing protocol transmits a packet to multicast a group at a given time instant to achieve a better utilization of resources. In this paper, node mobility is considered to map better their movement in the network. So, the links with long active duration time can be identified as a stable link for route construction. Variation in signal strength is used to identify whether the direction of the node is towards or away from estimating node. We consider signal strength as QoS metric to calculate link stability for route construction. Efforts are made to identify the link with highly probable longer lifetime as the best suitable link between two consecutive nodes. We predict the movement time of nodes that define the route path to the node destination. Exata/cyber simulator is used for network simulation. The simulation results of the proposed routing protocol are compared with on-demand multicast routing protocol and E-ODMRP, which works on minimum hop count path.

Causative factors that drive the increased penetrance of breast cancer in obese women are poorly characterized. Previously, we showed that BMI was positively correlated with DNA damage in breast epithelium of BRCA mutation carriers. We hypothesized that obesity-associated dysfunctional adipose tissue may cause DNA damage in neighboring breast epithelial cells. If true, this would provide evidence for the initial insults associated with increased risk of tumor formation in obese women. Methods: To test the effect of locally secreted factors on DNA damage induction, conditioned media was collected over 24 hours from primary breast adipose explants obtained from lean and obese women. Conditioned media was used to treat normal breast epithelial cells (MCF10A) harboring a heterozygous BRCA1 mutation or wildtype for BRCA. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining of the DNA damage marker ƴH2AX was carried out after treatment. Cell line findings were validated in primary breast epithelial organoids isolated by collagenase digestion of breast tissue obtained from the clinic. Additionally, RNA-seq was conducted on primary breast epithelial organoids isolated from lean and obese women to identify potential drivers of gene expression differences associated with obesity and DNA damage. Results: Conditioned media from obese breast adipose tissue stimulated DNA damage in BRCA mutant breast epithelial cells while lean conditioned media did not have this effect. Similar findings were made in primary breast epithelial organoids, suggesting a role for locally secreted factors in mediating DNA damage. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of RNA-seq data from lean and obese primary breast organoids identified several upstream regulators of gene expression differences, including signaling by estradiol and pro-inflammatory cytokines, both of which are elevated in obese breast tissue and are known inducers of DNA damage. Conclusions: These data show for the first time that local factors produced by obese breast adipose tissue induce breast epithelial cell DNA damage. Our results suggest that therapies targeting weight or dysfunctional breast adipose tissue may reduce the increased DNA damage observed in obese BRCA mutation carriers and thereby decrease tumor formation in this high-risk population of women.",1.0,0.25,False,"['F', 'M', 'F', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'F', 'M', 'F']","[None, None, None, None, None, 'Director, Englander Institute for Precision Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine', None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, 18277, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, 399, None, None, None]",17,1,0.0001039106756276,-1,1,0.10424372,0.5772311687469482,0.6417590379714966,0.4840318262577057,0.4585107266902923,0.378111869096756,1.0,35.0,18.0,364.0,174,96.73789173789174,0.7142857142857143,0.3450134770889488,2.070080862533693,7.041659029649594

Despite promising progress, existing representations learned with neural networks still struggle to generalize in closed-loop predictions (e.g., output colliding trajectories). This issue largely arises from the non-i.i.d. nature of sequential prediction in conjunction with ill-distributed training data. Intuitively, if the training data only comes from human behaviors in safe spaces, i.e., from “positive” examples, it is difficult for learning algorithms to capture the notion of “negative” examples like collisions. In this work, we aim to address this issue by explicitly modeling negative examples through self-supervision: (i) we introduce a social contrastive loss that regularizes the extracted motion representation by discerning the ground-truth positive events from synthetic negative ones; (ii) we construct informative negative samples based on our prior knowledge of rare but dangerous circumstances. Our method substantially reduces the collision rates of recent trajectory forecasting, behavioral cloning and reinforcement learning algorithms, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks.

Physical activity is one of the major lifestyle-related health determinants. However, such an important health-protecting behavior is seen to decline during adolescence. This study was undertaken to assess the physical activity pattern among adolescents and to find out the various factors influencing the same. 
 
An observational study was carried out among the adolescents in Diara village, Singur block, Hoogly district, West Bengal. The total adolescent population was nearly 450 out of the total population of 2252, that is approximately 20%. Of them, 25% were studied by selecting through simple random sampling from a suitable sample frame and interviewing with a questionnaire developed from International Physical Activity Questionnaire.(1) 
 
The day's activity was characterized into type of activity and its duration. 
 
Energy expenditure for each of the activities was computed by Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) for that duration x metabolic constant for that activity 
 
Total energy expenditure was computed by adding the full-day energy expenditure for all the activities with energy expenditure for growth. This value was compared with the standard total daily energy expenditure as per WHO guidelines.(2) 
 
Seventy percentage of the studied population were students (mostly the younger adolescents), 16% were carpenters, shop helpers, or housemaids, and 14% were unemployed(mostly the older girls). Approximately, they spent 10 h for their occupation, 1 h for travelling (cycling or walking), 1 h for household activities, 2 h for leisure, 2 h for miscellaneous activities, and 8 h for sleeping. Their household activities included sweeping, washing, cooking, cattle caring, looking after children and older people. Girls were more engaged in housework. Leisure activities of younger girls and boys were mainly games. Older girls spent most of their leisure time by watching TV, sewing, and gossiping. Seventy-eight percentage were sufficiently active, whereas 22% were less active. Of these, 70% had a normal BMI. None were found to be obese. Younger adolescents and school attendees were more active and the finding was statistically significant. Physical activities and gender did not show any statistically significant relationship [Table 1].

Relationship between the level of physical activity and various factors (n = 100) 
 
 
 
The study showed that most of the adolescents were sufficiently active, the level being more at younger age, as was also reported by Heath(3) and Kenneth(4) Besides occupational activity, use of active transport, housework, and games helped them to expend energy. Energy expenditure was more among the school attendees and that was probably due to participation in school's physical education program, as was also observed by Gordon-Larsen(5) Although physical activities and gender did not show any statistically significant relationship, leisure activities varied with age and sex. Older girls spent their leisure time for sedentary activities, probably due to lack of parental or social support for games, which was also reported by other studies.(6,7)

In contrast to the existing diffusion methods with a transition matrix determined solely by the graph structure, CAD considers both the node features and the graph structure with the design of the class-attentive transition matrix which utilizes the classifier. In addition, we further propose an adaptive scheme for AggCAD that leverages different reflection ratios of the diffusion result for each node depending on the local class-context. As the main advantage, AggCAD alleviates the problem of undesired mixing of inter-class features caused by discrepancies between node labels and the graph structure.

Clinicians' attention is a precious resource, which in the current healthcare practice is consumed by the cognitive demands arising from complex patient conditions, information overload, time pressure, and the need to aggregate and synthesize information from disparate sources. The ability to organize information in ways that facilitate the generation of effective diagnostic solutions is a distinguishing characteristic of expert physicians, suggesting that automated systems that organize clinical information in a similar manner may augment physicians' decision-making capabilities. In this paper, we describe the design and evaluation of a theoretically driven cognitive support system (CSS) that assists psychiatrists in their interpretation of clinical cases. The system highlights, and provides the means to navigate to, text that is organized in accordance with a set of diagnostically and therapeutically meaningful higher-level concepts.


METHODS AND MATERIALS
To evaluate the interface, 16 psychiatry residents interpreted two clinical case scenarios, with and without the CSS. Think-aloud protocols captured during their interpretation of the cases were transcribed and analyzed qualitatively. In addition, the frequency and relative position of content related to key higher-level concepts in a verbal summary of the case were evaluated. In addition the transcripts from both groups were compared to an expert derived reference standard using latent semantic analysis (LSA).


RESULTS
Qualitative analysis showed that users of the system better attended to specific clinically important aspects of both cases when these were highlighted by the system, and revealed ways in which the system mediates hypotheses generation and evaluation. Analysis of the summary data showed differences in emphasis with and without the system. The LSA analysis suggested users of the system were more ""expert-like"" in their emphasis, and that cognitive support was more effective in the more complex case.


CONCLUSIONS
Cognitive support impacts upon clinical comprehension. This appears to be largely helpful, but may also lead to neglect of information (such as the psychosocial history) that the system does not highlight. The results have implications for the design of CSSs for clinical narratives including the role of information organization and textual embellishments for more efficient clinical case presentation and comprehension.",3.0,0.3333333333333333,False,"['-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-']","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'University of Washington']","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 940]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 59]",10,-1,5.475976980449461e-05,-1,1,0.063247286,0.5983880162239075,0.642578661441803,0.6157406568527222,0.3852112591266632,0.5256134867668152,0.1428571428571428,3.071428571428572,1.2857142857142858,24.714285714285715,187,90.4380664652568,0.6011396011396012,0.339031339031339,2.128205128205128,-5.183653846153817

Drastic fluctuations of the waste heat caused by variable daily operation of mobile heavy-duty trucks bring an extreme transient power optimization challenge to ORC-WHR systems. Existing power optimization methods either neglect transient behavior of the Rankine cycle system or compromise model accuracy for computation efficiency. Different from literature, this study first time proposes a model-free reinforcement learning method to achieve online transient power optimization for the ORC-WHR system and explains the benefits of learning method in this application. A tabular Q-learning is formulated to optimize the net power on an experimentally validated ORC-WHR system. Q-learning is explained in detail using states, action, and policy information. To quantify the power optimization of the proposed method, Proper-Integral-Derivative method, state-of-art offline and online Dynamic Programming methods are implemented. The results showed that Q-learning generated 22% more cumulative energy than the energy Proper-Integral-Derivative method generated. Furthermore, Q-learning produces 96.6% of cumulative energy that the offline Dynamic Programming generates over a transient engine condition, while it requires less computation cost and is executed online. Additionally, the Q-learning produces 0.5% more cumulative energy than the machine learning-based online Dynamic Programming results and exhibits better vapor temperature robustness than the online Dynamic Programming method (4 °C-28 °C superheat by Q-learning vs. 5 °C-94 °C superheat by online Dynamic Programming).

A dataset of individual audio samples of four primary percussion instruments is used to obtain the spectral bases for each instrument. With these bases, we separate the input percussion ensemble recordings into its spectral sources and their activations using a Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) based algorithm. A simple onset detection conducted on each NMF activation presents satisfactory overall detection rates, and provides us valuable implications and suggestions for future development of drum transcription and percussion pattern analysis in Beijing Opera.",16.0,1.7777777777777777,False,"['F', 'M', 'M', 'M']","[None, 'Applied Science, Amazon Alexa, India', None, None]","[None, 42, None, None]","[None, 9, None, None]",11,-1,7.28275252463942e-05,-1,-1,0.12337088,0.4511352181434631,0.5145601034164429,0.3927485644817352,0.4284625649452209,0.3928722143173218,1.0,16.0,6.0,141.0,95,92.5,0.6549295774647887,0.3309859154929577,2.063380281690141,8.42052816901409

Although its communication range is short, NFC alone does not guarantee secure communication and is subject to security attacks, such as an eavesdropping attack. Generating a shared key and using symmetric key cryptography to secure the communication between NFC devices is a feasible solution to prevent various attacks. However, conventional Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocol is not preferable for resource constrained NFC devices due to its extensive computational overhead and energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a practical, fast and energy-efficient key agreement scheme, which uses random bits transmission with waveform shaking, for NFC devices by exploiting its off-the-shelf full-duplex capability. In the proposed method, two devices send random bits to each other simultaneously without strict synchronization or perfect match of amplitude and phase. On the contrary, the method randomly introduces synchronization offset and mismatch of amplitude and phase for each bit transmission in order to prevent a passive attacker from determining the generated key. A shared bit can be established when two devices send different bits. We conduct theoretical analysis on the correctness and security strength of the method, and extensive simulations to evaluate its effectiveness. We build a testbed based on USRP software defined radio and conduct proof-of-concept experiments to evaluate the method in a real-world environment. It shows that the proposed method achieves a high key generation rate of about 26 kbps and is immune to eavesdropping attack even when the attacker is within several centimeters from the legitimate devices.

The objectives of this review were to analyze recent advances in water quality remote sensing and determine limitations of current systems, estimation methods, and suggest future improvements. To that end, we collected over 200 sets of water quality data including blue-green algae phycocyanin (BGA-PC), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), dissolved oxygen (DO), specific conductivity (SC), fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM), turbidity, and pollution-sediments from 2016 to 2018. The water quality data, generated from laboratory analysis of grab samples and in-situ real-time monitoring sensors distributed in eight lakes and rivers in Midwestern United States, were paired with synchronous proximal spectra, tripod-mounted hyperspectral imagery, and satellite data. The results showed that both proximal and satellite-based sensors have great potential to provide accurate estimate of optically active parameters, and remote sensing of non-optically active parameters may be indirectly estimated but still remains a challenge. Data-driven empirical approaches, i.e., deep learning outperformed the other competing methods, providing promising possibility for operational use of remote sensing in water quality monitoring and decision-making. As the first-time review of deep neural networks for water quality estimation, the paper concludes that anomaly detection utilizing multi-sensor data fusion and virtual constellation in cloud-computing is the most promising means for predicting impending water pollution outbreaks such as algal blooms.",51.0,17.0,True,"['-', '-', '-', '-', 'M', '-', '-', 'M']","[None, None, 'Assistant Professor, Department of Geography & Geospatial Sciences,South Dakota State University', 'Assistant Professor', None, None, None, None]","[None, None, 428, 1294, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, 25, 65, None, None, None, None]",24,-1,5.7837665669557225e-05,-1,1,0.041884925,0.5216228365898132,0.6566279530525208,0.4582659602165222,0.4755050241947174,0.4759711623191833,0.0,54.0,7.0,242.0,162,94.3723849372385,0.7065637065637066,0.3629343629343629,2.1776061776061777,-12.509482625482605

Traditionally, the diversification mechanism is mostly realized by perturbing the incumbent solutions to escape from local optima.

In contrast to existing approaches, the proposed mechanism achieves the diversification by perturbing the instance under solving, rather than the solutions. To tackle the challenge of incorporating instance perturbation into hyper-heuristics, we also design a new hyper-heuristic framework HIP-HOP (recursive acronym of HIP-HOP is an instance perturbation-based hyper-heuristic optimization procedure), which employs a grammar guided high level strategy to manipulate the low level heuristics. With the expressive power of the grammar, the constraints, such as the feasibility of the output solution could be easily satisfied. Numerical results and statistical tests over both the Ising spin glass problem and the p-median problem instances show that HIP-HOP is able to achieve promising performances.

Within each hillside region a path close to the points of steepest slope on each MGP was established, and is referred to as an edge section. The edge sections were found to be similar to those from a Canny operator. For the present application, which was concerned with detection and characterization of blood vessels on angiograms, subsequent grouping was restricted to anti-symmetric hillside regions which formed a ridge with high grey values in the centre. The ridges corresponded closely to blood vessels shown in the image. The width of each ridge and the locus of its centre line were derived from anti-symmetric MGP pairs, and showed good agreement with expert judgement of vessel width and centre line location. Advantages of the MGP grouping method include: explicit representation of the profiles of grey values orthogonal to edges; ease of implementation of higher-order grouping stages, which are natural extensions of lower level grouping; and a hierarchical data structure, which allows improved interaction of bottom-up and top-down processing.",28.0,0.8484848484848485,False,"['-', '-', '-']","[None, None, 'Professor of Computer Science, University of Colombo School of Computing']","[None, None, None]","[None, None, 4]",9,-1,6.868318245725362e-05,-1,-1,0.15182193,0.4293861985206604,0.5754566788673401,0.5279936790466309,0.4972119927406311,0.3955204784870147,1.0,27.0,9.0,204.0,121,90.15706806282722,0.5924170616113744,0.2085308056872037,1.800947867298578,28.59231042654031

The proposed VBR controller relies on the fact that consecutive pictures within the same scene often exhibit similar degrees of complexity, and consequently should be encoded using similar quantization parameter (QP) values for the sake of quality consistency. In order to prevent unnecessary QP fluctuations, the proposed VBR controller allows for just an incremental variation of QP with respect to that of the previous picture, focusing on the design of an effective method for estimating this QP variation. The implementation in H.264/SVC requires to locate a rate controller at each dependency layer (spatial or coarse grain scalability). In particular, the QP increment estimation at each layer is computed by means of a radial basis function (RBF) network that is specially designed for this purpose. Furthermore, the RBF network design process was conceived to provide an effective solution for a wide range of practical real-time VBR applications for scalable video content delivery. In order to assess the proposed VBR controller, two real-time application scenarios were simulated: mobile live streaming and Internet protocol television broadcast. It was compared to constant QP encoding and a recently proposed constant bit rate (CBR) controller for H.264/SVC.

The purpose of this paper is to examine binomial- and Poisson-type approximations to the hypergeometric distribution, in order to find a simple but accurate approximation that can be successfully applied in acceptance sampling.Design/methodology/approachThe authors present a new binomial-type approximation for the type-A OC function, and derive its properties. Further, the authors compare this approximation via an extensive numerical study with other common approximations in terms of variation distance and relative efficiency under various conditions on the parameters including limiting cases.FindingsThe introduced approximation generates best numerical results over a wide range of parameter values, and ensures arithmetic simplicity of the binomial distribution and high accuracy to meet requirements regarding acceptance sampling problems. Additionally, it can considerably reduce the computational effort in relation to the type-A OC function and therefore is strongly recommended for calculating sampling plans.Originality/valueThe newly presented approximation provides a remarkably close fit to the type-A OC function, is discrete and needs no correction for continuity, and is skewed in the same direction by roughly the same amount as the exact OC. Due to less factorials, this OC in general involves lower powers than the type-A OC function.

Training a single model to estimate multiple sources generally does not perform as well as the independent dedicated models. However, Conditioned U-Net (C-U-Net) uses a control mechanism to train a single model for multi-source separation and attempts to achieve a performance comparable to that of the dedicated models. We propose a multi-channel U-Net (M-U-Net) trained using a weighted multi-task loss as an alternative to the C-U-Net. We investigate two weighting strategies for our multi-task loss: 1) Dynamic Weighted Average (DWA), and 2) Energy Based Weighting (EBW). DWA determines the weights by tracking the rate of change of loss of each task during training. EBW aims to neutralize the effect of the training bias arising from the difference in energy levels of each of the sources in a mixture. Our methods provide three-fold advantages compared to C-U-Net: 1) Fewer effective training iterations per epoch, 2) Fewer trainable network parameters (no control parameters), and 3) Faster processing at inference.

For both breeds, similar estimates of additive and phenotypic variances and narrow and broad-sense heritability values were obtained across the evaluated models except when GxG effect was considered. In this case, additive variance was slightly lower than that obtained in the models which do not consider this effect. The estimated dominance and epistatic variances from additive and dominance effects (AD) and additive, dominance and epistatic effects models (ADE) were greater than that ADH and ADEH models (as described above plus heterozygosity as a covariate). However, all genetic parameter estimates were associated with a large standard deviation. Averaged across ADH and ADHE models, the magnitude of dominance variance compared to the phenotypic variance of YWT was 14% (BB) and 10% (TC). The magnitude of epistasis compared to the phenotypic variance for BB and TC was 17% and 29%, respectively for GxG; 0.7% and 0% for GxD; and 0% and 0% for DxD. The inclusion of nonadditive effects slightly improves the predictive accuracy of breeding values from 0.28 for A to 0.33 for ADHEGxG and from 0.18 for A to 0.23 ADEGxD in BB and TC cattle. Models that included heterozygosity (ADH and ADHE) must be used to estimate nonadditive genetic variance components. A 1 Mb sliding window analysis identified a region on BTA 14 explaining 10.08% and 1.21% of total genetic variance (additive + dominance) of YWT in BB and TC, respectively. Our results suggest that dominance, epistasis, and heterozygosity should be included in models for genetic parameters estimation. To identify the animals with the highest additive genetic value in selection decisions, only the additive effect should be used in evaluation models.",12.0,2.4,False,"['-', '-', '-', '-', '-', 'M']","[None, None, 'Senior Research Scientist, CSIRO', None, None, None]","[None, None, 1495, None, None, None]","[None, None, 55, None, None, None]",12,-1,0.0003035655511893,-1,1,0.08111636,0.6238008141517639,0.635331392288208,0.5248212814331055,0.4962320029735565,0.4806350171566009,1.0,67.0,14.0,347.0,159,86.43491124260355,0.6424581005586593,0.3072625698324022,2.0279329608938546,10.09987150837992

However, for aggregation to be effective, the individual machine learning techniques must be as accurate as possible. Therefore, this paper is presented in two major phases. In the first phase, the selection procedure of those individual machine learning techniques and the adopted strategies to make them as accurate as possible are briefly explained. According to the experimental results the most potential three machine learning techniques namely Least Median Square (LMS), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were selected for the components of the hybrid prediction method. After applying each of the improvement strategies on the machine learning techniques, six hours ahead solar power predictions were performed and justified with the error validation metrics. The prediction outcome of each and every step was compared with the prediction outcome of the previous steps to ensure the continual improvement of the prediction accuracy of those individuals. All the prediction accuracy results executed by the individuals in the first phase are summarized which clearly reveals a significant contribution of this paper. It is found from the summarized results that those individual machine learning techniques reach at the best of their accuracy level by the combined effect of applying feature selection and parameter optimization on them. In the second phase, the best possible individual accurate predictions from LMS, MLP and SVM are passed as inputs towards the Mamdani FIS to accomplish the task to non-linearly integrate them.

In this paper, we review different structures of deep directed generative models and the learning and inference algorithms associated with the structures. We focus on a specific structure that consists of layers of Bayesian Networks due to the property of capturing inherent and rich dependencies among latent variables. The major difficulty of learning and inference with deep directed models with many latent variables is the intractable inference due to the dependencies among the latent variables and the exponential number of latent variable configurations. Current solutions use variational methods often through an auxiliary network to approximate the posterior probability inference. In contrast, inference can also be performed directly without using any auxiliary network to maximally preserve the dependencies among the latent variables. Specifically, by exploiting the sparse representation with the latent space, max-max instead of max-sum operation can be used to overcome the exponential number of latent configurations. Furthermore, the max-max operation and augmented coordinate ascent are applied to both supervised and unsupervised learning as well as to various inference.

Our purposes were to: (1) determine the optimal CT perfusion parameter to define infarct core using various postprocessing platforms; and (2) establish the degree of variability in threshold values between these different platforms. Methods— We evaluated 48 consecutive cases with vessel occlusion and admission CT perfusion and diffusion-weighted imaging within 3 hours of each other. CT perfusion was acquired with a “second-generation” 66-second biphasic cine protocol and postprocessed using “standard” (from 2 vendors, “A-std” and “B-std”) and “delay-corrected” (from 1 vendor, “A-dc”) commercial software. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed comparing each CT perfusion parameter—both absolute and normalized to the contralateral uninvolved hemisphere—between infarcted and noninfarcted regions as defined by coregistered diffusion-weighted imaging. Results— Cerebral blood flow had the highest accuracy (receiver operating characteristic area under the curve) for all 3 platforms (P<0.01). The maximal areas under the curve for each parameter were: absolute cerebral blood flow 0.88, cerebral blood volume 0.81, and mean transit time 0.82 and relative Cerebral blood flow 0.88, cerebral blood volume 0.83, and mean transit time 0.82.

This paper investigates the pragmatic expressions of negative evaluation (negativity) in two corpora: (i) comments posted online in response to newspaper opinion articles; and (ii) online reviews of movies, books and consumer products. We propose a taxonomy of linguistic resources that are deployed in the expression of negativity, with two broad groups at the top level of the taxonomy: resources from the lexicogrammar or from discourse semantics. We propose that rhetorical figures can be considered part of the discourse semantic resources used in the expression of negativity. Using our taxonomy as starting point, we carry out a corpus analysis, and focus on three phenomena: adverb + adjective combinations; rhetorical questions; and rhetorical figures. Although the analysis in this paper is corpus-assisted rather than corpus-driven, the final goal of our research is to make it quantitative, in extracting patterns and resources that can be detected automatically.

Numerical methods such as Finite Difference (FD) modelling and Spectral Element Methods (SEM) are the most popular techniques for simulating seismic waves in complex media, but for many tasks their computational cost is prohibitively expensive. In this work we present two types of deep neural networks as fast alternatives for simulating seismic waves in horizontally layered and faulted 2D acoustic media. In contrast to the classical methods both networks are able to simulate the seismic response at multiple locations within the media in a single inference step, without needing to iteratively model the seismic wavefield through time, resulting in an order of magnitude reduction in simulation time. This speed improvement could pave the way to real-time seismic simulation and benefit seismic inversion algorithms based on forward modelling, such as full waveform inversion. Our first network is able to simulate seismic waves in horizontally layered media. We use a WaveNet network architecture and show this is more accurate than a standard convolutional network design. Furthermore we show that seismic inversion can be carried out by retraining the network with its inputs and outputs reversed, offering a fast alternative to existing inversion techniques. Our second network is significantly more general than the first; it is able to simulate seismic waves in faulted media with arbitrary layers, fault properties and an arbitrary location of the seismic source on the surface of the media. It uses a convolutional autoencoder network design and is conditioned on the input source location. We investigate the sensitivity of different network designs and training hyperparameters on its simulation accuracy. We compare and contrast this network to the first network. To train both networks we introduce a time-dependent gain in the loss function which improves convergence. We discuss the relative merits of our approach with FD modelling and how our approach could be generalised to simulate more complex Earth models.

We present a new dataset related to a specific natural disaster event, i.e. Hurricane Harvey, that distinguishes user’s tweets into positive and non-positive attitudes.

Soft Comput.,"Abstract Multivariate time series data come as a collection of time series describing different aspects of a certain temporal phenomenon. Anomaly detection in this type of data constitutes a challenging problem yet with numerous applications in science and engineering because anomaly scores come from the simultaneous consideration of the temporal and variable relationships. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based approach to detect anomalies concerning the amplitude and the shape of multivariate time series. First, we use a sliding window to generate a set of multivariate subsequences and thereafter apply an extended fuzzy clustering to reveal a structure present within the generated multivariate subsequences. Finally, a reconstruction criterion is employed to reconstruct the multivariate subsequences with the optimal cluster centers and the partition matrix. We construct a confidence index to quantify a level of anomaly detected in the series and apply Particle Swarm Optimization as an optimization vehicle for the problem of anomaly detection. Experimental studies completed on several synthetic and six real-world datasets suggest that the proposed methods can detect the anomalies in multivariate time series. With the help of available clusters revealed by the extended fuzzy clustering, the proposed framework can detect anomalies in the multivariate time series and is suitable for identifying anomalous amplitude and shape patterns in various application domains such as health care, weather data analysis, finance, and disease outbreak detection.",2.0,1.0,False,"['-', 'M', '-', 'M']","[None, 'Workday', None, 'Trialog']","[None, 1728, None, 279]","[None, 27, None, 32]",8,-1,5.7837665669557225e-05,-1,-1,0.032346748,0.3454824388027191,0.5866249799728394,0.471304714679718,0.3709756135940552,0.4057179689407348,1.0,17.0,8.0,226.0,126,91.41826923076924,0.6403508771929824,0.3552631578947368,2.179824561403509,-6.302657894736797

This paper presents a novel application of sentiment analysis to recommender systems relying on explicit one-class user feedback (favorites or likes), namely joint models of unary feedback and sentiment of free-form user comments. This combination is achieved through a mapping function within a sentiment-aware nearest neighbor model (SANN), which serves as an effective personalized ranker of items according to their hypothesized relevance to users. The mapping function can be adapted to specific datasets through a machine learning algorithm. We evaluate the proposed models and compare them with state-of-the-art multimedia recommendation methods, by casting the recommendation task as a top-N retrieval task over three real-world datasets: TED lectures, Vimeo videos and Flickr images. The experimental results show that the proposed models outperform all other alternatives in a majority of cases, thus demonstrating the generality of the approach.

IMMACCS has been implemented as a three-tier architecture that distinguishes between information, logic and presentation. It utilizes an object-serving communication facility with subscription and multi-casting capabilities that is based on the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA). With an emphasis on application, IMMACCS was designed and implemented in concert with its military users as an integral component of experiments conceived by the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory to test emerging concepts in military command and control. It was field tested as the command and control system of record during the Urban Warrior Advanced Warfighting Experiment conducted by the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory in Monterey and Oakland, California, March 12 to 18, 1999. Principal Design Notions and System Components. IMMACCS is an adaptive, distributed, open architecture system that is intended to assist military commanders under battle-like conditions when dynamic information changes, complex relationships, and time pressures tend to stress the cognitive capabilities of decision makers and their staff. IMMACCS incorporates four design notions that are fundamental to its decision-assistance capabilities. Notion 1: Whereas legacy systems typically process data, IMMACCS processes information. The key to the assistance capabilities of IMMACCS is that the system has some ‘understanding’ of the information that it is processing. In IMMACCS every entity in the screen display of the battlefield (e.g., road, building, truck, tank, enemy unit, civilian group, etc.) as well as intangible entities such as weather, attack, defense, and so on, are represented as individual objects with characteristics and relationships to each other. Therefore, the military commander and staff officer interacts with a computer display that consists of hundreds of real world entities (objects) that all have some ‘understanding’ of each other’s nature, interests and objectives, and a great deal of ‘understanding’ of their own characteristics and capabilities. Notion 2: IMMACCS is a collection of powerful collaborative tools, not a library of predefined solutions. This approach is intended to overcome the deficiencies of legacy systems in which built-in solutions to predetermined problems often differ significantly from the complex operational situations encountered in the real world. IMMACCS is a collaborative decision-support system in which the operators interact with computer-based agents (i.e., decision tools) to solve problems that cannot be precisely nor easily predetermined. Notion 3: IMMACCS incorporates agents that are able to reason about the characteristics and the relationships of the many real world entities (i.e., objects) that are recognized within its representational schema (i.e., ontology). Pohl J., A. Wood, K.J. Pohl and A. Chapman; ‘IMMACCS: A Military Decision-Support System’; DARPA-JFACC Symposium on Advances in Enterprise Control, San Diego, California, Nov.15-16, 1999. 2 During its first field test (held in California, March 1999 [1]) IMMACCS included agents capable of providing assistance in decision areas involving: weapon selection and deconfliction; Rules of Engagement; potential fratricide situations; enemy engagements and decision points; and, logistical re-supply requirements. In addition, IMMACCS supports mentor agents that can be dynamically created to represent the interests of warfighters and warfighting machines. Mentor agents are intended to extend the capabilities of Marines at all levels by warning friendly units of hostile intrusions into their territory. Notion 4: IMMACCS integrates planning, execution and training within one common command and control user environment. The computer-based agents and the IMMACCS users continuously collaborate as they interact with each other in rapidly changing battlefield situations. In this respect IMMACCS reflects the complexity of the real world where problem solutions must be continuously reviewed as conditions change, and it becomes increasingly difficult and inconvenient to separate planning, re-planning, execution, and training functions into artificially discrete activities supported by different applications. IMMACCS is one integrated system and not a confederation of loosely linked sub-systems. Its architecture is based on the Integrated Collaborative Decision Model (ICDM) [2] [3] multi-agent system development framework applied by the CAD Research Center previously in engineering design [4] [5], transportation planning [6] [7] and military command and control [8] [9]. In its field testing state in March 1999, IMMACCS consisted of the following integrated components (Fig.1): An Object Model (designed and developed by the CAD Research Center) that facilitates the internal representation of information (rather than data). In particular, IMMACCS supports the dynamic formation of associations among objects at both the user and agent levels. An Agent Engine (designed and developed by the CAD Research Center) that automatically initiates an agent session in support of any desired View of the battlespace.

All IMMACCS components are clients of the Shared Net and indicate their information interests by registering a subscription profile. Whenever, information that is within the subscription of one or more clients (whether military Pohl J., A. Wood, K.J. Pohl and A. Chapman; ‘IMMACCS: A Military Decision-Support System’; DARPA-JFACC Symposium on Advances in Enterprise Control, San Diego, California, Nov.15-16, 1999. 3 commander or squad leader) becomes available the Shared Net automatically pushes this information into a cache memory area and sends an alert message to the client. In addition, clients may also query for information for which they have not subscribed. Even individual agent sessions are clients to the Shared Net and can therefore take advantage of these efficient communication capabilities. A hardware independent Object Browser (designed and developed by the CAD Research Center) that facilitates user interaction within the object-based information context and the collaborative agent assistance capabilities of IMMACCS. Through the Object Browser the user may: set alert conditions (e.g., request warning of enemy advances to within a user-specified radius of the current position of the operator); obtain agent reports and suggestions; request agent explanations; explore the location and capabilities of key resources (e.g., local police and fire stations, hospitals, and government buildings) on the object-based infrastructure display of the battlefield; and, enter information to automatically activate any other client(s) of the Shared Net. A set of Translators (designed and developed by the SPAWAR Systems Center) that are capable of mapping data received from external applications, such as the Joint Maritime Command Information System (JMCIS), to the object-based representation held within the IMMACCS Object Model. A hardware independent, lightweight 2-D Viewer user interface (designed and developed by SRI International) that connects the Marine in the battlespace via wireless communication to IMMACCS. Each 2D Viewer hardware device is provided with a differential GPS (Global Positioning System) facility that transmits automatic position reports to IMMACCS. In this way IMMACCS is able to automatically track the current position of all beacon equipped friendly units, and make this information available to agents as they spontaneously and opportunistically reason about events which might affect these units. A Geographic Infrastructure Database (designed and developed by the Naval Research Laboratory at Stennis Space Center) that provides objectified battlespace infrastructure from NIMA Vector Product Format (VPF) data. The Fundamental Requirement of ‘Information’ Representation. Although technological advances in computer hardware and communication systems have been truly astounding over the past 20 years, the direct utilization of these advances in the area of decision-support has been less than remarkable. The fact is that we are still using computers largely as data processing devices that perform only the most menial and least intelligent data transmission and manipulation tasks. While computers are performing these tasks with great speed and accuracy, and while they are able to provide connectivity among a virtually unlimited number of access points, the higher level and much more rewarding tasks of analyzing, interpreting and abstracting data as ‘information’ and inferring ‘knowledge’ is almost entirely left to the human users. This serious deficiency has become increasingly apparent as technological advances have increased computing power, data storage capacities, and data transmission speeds by orders of magnitude in such a short period of time. Convenient global access to users and data has increased the need for information filtering, so that individuals might take advantage of the opportunities for material and personal profit that this connectivity and processing power present to the user. Needless to say, the capabilities of a computer to assist in the intelligent assessment of information are basically n",2.0,0.1052631578947368,False,"['-', '-']","[None, None, None]","[None, None, None]","[None, None, None]",4,-1,5.475976980449461e-05,-1,1,0.17613992,0.5190168619155884,0.5959591269493103,0.4915056228637695,0.3680696487426758,0.4558185636997223,1.0,249.0,51.0,1416.0,560,92.39764052741153,0.649555099247091,0.2943189596167009,2.067077344284737,3.235756673511304

To deal with such large-scale training data, the learning algorithms are usually based on stochastic gradient descent with uniformly drawn pairs. However, the uniformly sampling strategy often results in slow convergence. In this paper, we first uncover the reasons of slow convergence. Then, we associate contents of entities with characteristics of data sets to develop an adaptive item sampler for drawing informative training data. In this end, to devise a robust personalized ranking method, we accordingly embed our sampler into Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) framework, and further propose a Content-aware and Adaptive Bayesian Personalized Ranking (CA-BPR) method, which can model both contents and implicit feedbacks in a unified learning process. The experimental results show that, our adaptive item sampler indeed can speed up BPR learning and CA-BPR definitively outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in personalized ranking.",6.0,0.75,False,"['-', '-', '-', '-']","[None, None, 'National Lab of Pattern Recognition', None]","[None, None, 8092, None]","[None, None, 141, None]",11,-1,6.132763018194634e-05,-1,-1,0.082228094,0.5245087146759033,0.6345198750495911,0.5481041669845581,0.4475999772548675,0.3852661252021789,1.0,29.0,9.0,177.0,111,92.98780487804878,0.6413043478260869,0.266304347826087,2.0,17.639500000000027

Stokes polarization parameters and degree of polarization (DoP) are calculated to extract the polarimetric information of the 3D scene while integral imaging reconstruction provides depth information and improves the performance of low-light imaging tasks. An LWIR wire grid polarizer and a linear polarizer film are used as polarimetric objects for the LWIR range and visible range cameras, respectively. To account for a limited number of photons per pixel using the visible range camera in low light conditions, we apply a mathematical restoration model at each elemental image of visible camera to enhance the signal. We show that the low noise visible range camera may outperform the LWIR camera in detection of polarimetric objects under low illumination conditions.

This, however, introduces noise and leads to low performance. This paper proposes a bilingual dependency mapping model for BLC which encodes a word’s context as a combination of its dependent words and their relationships. This combination can provide more reliable clues than mere context words for bilingual translation words. We further demonstrate that this kind of bilingual dependency mappings can be successfully generated and maximally exploited without human intervention. The experiments on BLC from English to Chinese show that, by mapping context words and their dependency relationships simultaneously when calculating the similarity between bilingual words, our approach significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art one by ~14 units in accuracy for frequently occurring noun pairs and similarly, though in a less degree, for nouns and verbs in a wide frequency range. This justifies the effectiveness of our dependency mapping model for BLC.

Mag.,"With the advent of WDM technology, IP backbone carriers are now connecting core routers directly over point-to-point WDM links (IP over WDM). The advances and standardization in optical control plane technologies like GMPLS have substantially increased the intelligence of the optical layer and shown promise toward making dynamic provisioning and restoration of optical layer circuits a basic capability to be leveraged by upper network layers. In light of this, an architecture where a reconfigurable optical backbone (IP over OTN) consisting of SONET/SDH crossconnects/switches interconnected via DWDM links provides connectivity among IP routers is an emerging alternative. As carriers evolve their networks to meet the continued growth of data traffic in the Internet, they have to make a fundamental choice between the above architectural alternatives. In the current business environment, this decision is likely to be guided by network cost and scalability concerns. A reconfigurable optical backbone provides a flexible transport infrastructure that eases many operational hurdles, such as fast provisioning, robust restoration, and disaster recovery. It can also be shared with other service networks such as ATM, frame relay, and SONET/SDH. From that perspective, an agile transport infrastructure is definitely the architecture of choice. The IP-over-OTN solution is also more scalable since the core of the network in this architecture is based on more scalable optical switches rather than IP routers. But what about cost? Since the IP-over-OTN solution introduces a new network element, the optical switch, is it more expensive? We address that question by comparing IP-over-WDM and IP-over-OTN architectures from an economic standpoint using real-life network data. We show that contrary to common wisdom, IP over OTN can lead to substantial reduction in capital expenditure through reduction of expensive transit IP router ports. The savings increases rapidly with the number of nodes in the network and traffic demand between nodes. The economies of scale for the IP-over-OTN backbone increase substantially when we move traffic restoration from the IP layer to the optical layer. We also compare the two architectures from the perspective of scalability, flexibility, and robustness. Our observations make a strong case in favor of a switched optical backbone for building scalable IP networks.",140.0,7.0,False,"['-', 'M', '-']","[None, None, None]","[None, None, None]","[None, None, None]",9,-1,5.475976980449461e-05,1,-1,0.09671353,0.5381720066070557,0.51381516456604,0.4905155599117279,0.4778679311275482,0.3461956977844238,0.0,52.0,17.0,357.0,187,91.95467422096316,0.6112600536193029,0.260053619302949,1.9812332439678284,17.907667560321727

Motivated by the well-studied research area of community detection algorithms that aggregate strongly connected users with similar interests and behaviors, in this article, we propose a community-based hashtag recommendation framework, which studies hashtag recommendation through tweet similarity task and applies it on communities detected using the Clique percolation method, Louvain algorithm, and label propagation method. The detected communities are extracted from four social network constructions based on following, mention, hashtag, and topic. Compared to the three state-of-the-art hashtag recommendation methods, our extensive experiments show that our community-based method outperforms these methods, thus giving a higher hit rate. Our in-depth analysis demonstrates that the performance of hashtag recommendation is the best when the communities are generated using the Clique percolation method (CPM) from the network of users who share similar usage of hashtags.",7.0,2.333333333333333,False,"['F', 'M', '-']","[None, None, 'The University of Western Australia']","[None, None, 2338]","[None, None, 97]",10,-1,5.4974081701455374e-05,-1,-1,0.090644576,0.5481251478195189,0.5247706770896912,0.5556861162185669,0.50126051902771,0.4386332333087921,1.0,28.0,7.0,192.0,116,91.95530726256985,0.6231155778894473,0.2613065326633166,2.040201005025126,6.422994974874371

Graded doses of bradykinin (47-377 pmol/min) and bradykinin 1-5 (47-18,850 pmol/min) were infused in the brachial artery in random order in 36 healthy subjects. Forearm blood flow (FBF) was measured, and simultaneously obtained venous and arterial plasma samples were analyzed for tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen. In seven subjects each, α- and γ-thrombin-induced platelet aggregation was measured in platelet-rich plasma obtained from antecubital venous blood at baseline and during peptide infusions. Bradykinin caused dose-dependent increases in FBF and net t-PA release (P < 0.001 for both). Bradykinin 1-5 did not affect FBF (P = 0.13) or net t-PA release (P = 0.46) at concentrations >1500 times physiologic. In contrast, both bradykinin and bradykinin 1-5 inhibited α-and γ-thrombin-induced platelet aggregation (P < 0.01 versus baseline).

Neither bradykinin nor bradykinin 1-5 affected thrombin receptor-activating peptide-induced platelet aggregation, consistent with the hypothesis that bradykinin and bradykinin 1-5 inhibit thrombin-induced platelet aggregation by preventing cleavage of the thrombin receptor and liberation of thrombin receptor-activating peptide.

Observational studies suggest that even minor variations in thyroid function are associated with the risk of mood disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). However, it is unknown whether these associations are causal or not. We used a Mendelian Randomization (MR) approach to investigate causal effects of minor variations in TSH and FT4 levels on MDD and BD risk.


METHODS
Two-sample MR using data from the largest publicly available genome-wide association studies on normal-range TSH (N=54,288) and FT4 (N=49,269) levels, MDD (170,756 cases, 329,443 controls) and BD (20,352 cases, 31,358 controls). Secondary MR analyses investigated the effects of TSH and FT4 levels on specific MDD and BD subtypes. Reverse MR was also performed to assess the effects of MDD and BD on TSH and FT4 levels.


RESULTS
There were no associations between genetically predicted TSH and FT4 levels and MDD risk, nor MDD subtypes and minor depressive symptoms. A one standard deviation increase in FT4 levels was nominally associated with an 11% decrease in the overall BD risk (OR=0.89, 95%CI=0.80-0.98, P=0.022) and a 13% decrease in the BD type 1 risk (OR=0.87, 95%CI=0.75-1.00, P=0.047). In the reverse direction, genetic predisposition to MDD and BD was not associated with TSH nor FT4 levels.


CONCLUSIONS
Variations in normal-range TSH and FT4 levels have no effects on the risk of MDD and its subtypes, and neither on minor depressive symptoms. This indicates that depressive symptoms should not be attributed to minor variations in thyroid function. Borderline associations with BD and BD type 1 risks suggest that further clinical studies should investigate the effect of thyroid hormone treatment in BD.",1.0,0.5,False,"['M', '-', 'F', '-', '-', 'F', '-', 'M', '-', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'F', 'M']","[None, None, 'Queen Mary University London', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, 3695, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, 38, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",11,-1,0.0004859560723853,-1,1,0.06924601,0.6050660014152527,0.6463273167610168,0.5370215177536011,0.4868304431438446,0.5087172985076904,0.0,3.571428571428572,1.1428571428571428,19.285714285714285,142,91.66071428571428,0.69,0.1866666666666666,1.75,28.33500000000004

Germline de novo truncating variants in ASXL1 and ASXL3 have been respectively implicated in causing Bohring-Opitz and Bainbridge-Ropers syndromes, which result in overlapping features of severe intellectual disability and dysmorphic features. ASXL2 has not yet been associated with a human Mendelian disorder. In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing in six unrelated probands with developmental delay, macrocephaly, and dysmorphic features. All six had de novo truncating variants in ASXL2. A careful review enabled the recognition of a specific phenotype consisting of macrocephaly, prominent eyes, arched eyebrows, hypertelorism, a glabellar nevus flammeus, neonatal feeding difficulties, hypotonia, and developmental disabilities. Although overlapping features with Bohring-Opitz and Bainbridge-Ropers syndromes exist, features that distinguish the ASXL2-associated condition from ASXL1- and ASXL3-related disorders are macrocephaly, absence of growth retardation, and more variability in the degree of intellectual disabilities. We were also able to demonstrate with mRNA studies that these variants are likely to exert a dominant-negative effect, given that both alleles are expressed in blood and the mutated ASXL2 transcripts escape nonsense-mediated decay. In conclusion, de novo truncating variants in ASXL2 underlie a neurodevelopmental syndrome with a clinically recognizable phenotype.

Environment and Genotype by Environment Interaction also contributed significant effect on performance of some yield components. The highest average grain yield was recorded from the variety IS9302 (2635 kg/ha) followed by Birmash (2537 kg/ha) across locations. Four parametric stability methods including: Lin and Binns’s Cultivar Performance Measure (Pi), Wricke’s Ecovalence (WI), Static stability and GGbiplot methods that consider both yield and stability were conducted. Based on those parameters genotype IS9302 showed high mean yield and stability across locations. Participant farmers’ prioritized seven traits: head size, panicle length, earliness, grain color, disease and pest tolerance, stalk vigor and plant height. Hence, farmer’s preferences in a variety selection process more prioritized yield-related traits. The best varieties ranked by traits of interest were IS9302, Dagem and Birmash that performed well under their circumstances. Hence, the results showed that farmers’ preferred varieties matches with researchers’. Therefore, based on objectively measured traits, farmers preferences and the agro ecologies of the site varieties IS9302, Dagem and Birmash were found promising for production in the mid altitude of North Gondar and similar agro ecologies.",6.0,3.0,False,"['-', '-']","['Research Engineer, Southwest Research Institute', None]","[1273, None]","[54, None]",14,-1,6.868318245725362e-05,-1,1,0.04175503,0.4001069962978363,0.6720268130302429,0.3872916400432586,0.4224046468734741,0.5245245695114136,1.0,41.0,12.0,237.0,152,93.45982142857144,0.7213114754098361,0.3360655737704918,2.14344262295082,5.402754098360674

This approach makes use of the fact that many transparent objects, especially the ones consisting of usual glass, absorb light in certain wavelengths [1]. Given a controlled illumination, this absorption is measurable in the intensity response by comparison to the background. We show the usage of a standard infrared emitter and the intensity sensor of a time of flight (ToF) camera to reconstruct the structure given we have a second view point. The structure can not be measured by the usual 3D measurements of the ToF camera. We take advantage of this fact by deriving this internal sensory contradiction from two ToF images and reconstruct an approximated surface of the original transparent object. Therefor we are using a perspectively invariant matching in the intensity channels from the first to the second view of initially acquired candidates. For each matched pixel in the first view a 3D movement can be predicted given their original 3D measurement and the known distance to the second camera position. If their line of sight did not pass a transparent object or suffered any other major defect, this prediction will highly correspond to the actual measured 3D points of the second view. Otherwise, if a detectable error occurs, we approximate a more exact point to point matching and reconstruct the original shape by triangulating the points in the stereo setup. We tested our approach using a mobile platform with one Swissranger SR4k. As this platform is mobile, we were able to create a stereo setup by moving it. Our results show a detection of transparent objects on tables while simultaneously identifying opaque objects that also existed in the test setup. The viability of our results is demonstrated by a successful automated manipulation of the respective transparent object.",21.0,1.75,False,"['M', '-', '-']","[None, 'University of Southern California', None]","[None, 99, None]","[None, 8, None]",9,-1,5.245676727216794e-05,-1,1,0.0676266,0.605120062828064,0.5338929891586304,0.4501558542251587,0.4080424308776855,0.3553445041179657,1.0,25.0,14.0,305.0,158,91.19298245614036,0.5704918032786885,0.2524590163934426,1.859016393442623,27.435213114754102

As a tertiary production processes, chemical flooding is one of the effective technologies to increase oil recovery of hydrocarbon reservoirs. Retention of surfactants is one of the key parameters affecting the performance and economy of a chemical flooding process. The main parameters contribute to surfactant retention are mineralogy of rock, surfactant structure, pH, salinity, acidity of the oil, microemulsion viscosity, co-solvent concentration, and mobility. Despite various theoretical studies carried out so far, a comprehensive and reliable predictive model for surfactant retention is still found lacking. In this communication, a mathematical method based on machine learning approach, namely, least square support vector machine modeling is evolved for this purpose. To this end, the model was developed and tested using experimental dynamic surfactant retention data over a wide range of conditions. The results show that the developed model provides predictions in good agreement with experimental retention data. Moreover, it is shown that the developed model is capable of simulating the actual physical trend of surfactant retention versus three most important input parameters: total acid number of oil, pH, and mobility ratio. Finally, for detection of the probable doubtful retention data, outlier diagnosis was performed on the whole data set.",20.0,2.2222222222222223,False,"['-', 'M', 'M', '-']","[None, None, 'The University of Adelaide', None]","[None, None, 188, None]","[None, None, 6, None]",12,-1,6.377048944391246e-05,-1,-1,0.1060272,0.37601238489151,0.4114384353160858,0.4721624255180359,0.3117684125900268,0.2630630135536194,1.0,30.0,10.0,207.0,130,92.65957446808513,0.6682692307692307,0.375,2.1346153846153846,5.23603846153847

These mesh routers are minimal mobile and mesh clients are totally mobile. The protocols of ad hoc network are used in WMN. These protocols assume that every node is mobile. But as the mesh routers are minimal mobile or not mobile, the protocols brings overhead for the mesh routers. Our task is to relieve mesh routers using ad hoc network protocol from the overhead and define a better protocol which will fit in WMN efficiently. To do so, we've found that the existing architecture of WMN is needed to be changed slightly. We have proposed a new architecture for wireless mesh network.

Although much progress has been made, tinnitus remains a scientific and clinical enigma of high prevalence and high economic burden, with an estimated prevalence of 10%-20% among the adult population. The EU is funding a new collaborative project entitled ""Unification of Treatments and Interventions for Tinnitus Patients"" (UNITI, grant no. 848261) under its Horizon 2020 framework. The main goal of the UNITI project is to set the ground for a predictive computational model based on existing and longitudinal data attempting to address the question of which treatment or combination of treatments is optimal for a specific patient group based on certain parameters. Clinical, epidemiological, genetic and audiological data, including signals reflecting ear-brain communication, as well as patients' medical history, will be analyzed making use of existing databases. Predictive factors for different patient groups will be extracted and their prognostic relevance validated through a Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) in which different patient groups will undergo a combination of tinnitus therapies targeting both auditory and central nervous systems. From a scientific point of view, the UNITI project can be summarized into the following research goals: (1) Analysis of existing data: Results of existing clinical studies will be analyzed to identify subgroups of patients with specific treatment responses and to identify systematic differences between the patient groups at the participating clinical centers. (2) Genetic and blood biomarker analysis: High throughput Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) will be performed in well-characterized chronic tinnitus cases, together with Proximity Extension Assays (PEA) for the identification of blood biomarkers for tinnitus. (3) RCT: A total of 500 patients will be recruited at five clinical centers across Europe comparing single treatments against combinational treatments. The four main treatments are Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), hearing aids, sound stimulation, and structured counseling. The consortium will also make use of e/m-health applications for the treatment and assessment of tinnitus. (4) Decision Support System: An innovative Decision Support System will be implemented, integrating all available parameters (epidemiological, clinical, audiometry, genetics, socioeconomic and medical history) to suggest specific examinations and the optimal intervention strategy based on the collected data. (5) Financial estimation analysis: A cost-effectiveness analysis for the respective interventions will be calculated to investigate the economic effects of the interventions based on quality-adjusted life years.

Currently, fall detection has attracted a lot of research attention and machine learning (ML) has shown promising performance in this task due to their strengths in person recognition. However, many existing methods using RGB images as the training data, resulting in the main information to be lost, or do not appropriately consider the effect of light, resulting in weak generalizability of the fall detection. Moreover, traditional methods pose a risk of leakage of personal privacy. This paper proposes a fall detection IoT system based on depth camera and fast Fourier transform (FFT) to overcome these problems. We first use depth camera to get the skeleton images of a person who is standing or falling down.

As a complementary information to the high‐throughput experimental data, domain knowledge like the Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway is usually used to guide gene function analysis. However, functional annotation for miRNAs is scarce in the public databases. Till now, only a few methods have been proposed for measuring the functional similarity between miRNAs based on public annotation data, and these methods cover a very limited number of miRNAs, which are not applicable to large‐scale miRNA analysis. Results: In this paper, we propose a new method to measure the functional similarity for miRNAs, called miRGOFS, which has two notable features: (i) it adopts a new GO semantic similarity metric which considers both common ancestors and descendants of GO terms; (i) it computes similarity between GO sets in an asymmetric manner, and weights each GO term by its statistical significance. The miRGOFS‐based predictor achieves an F1 of 61.2% on a benchmark dataset of miRNA localization, and AUC values of 87.7 and 81.1% on two benchmark sets of miRNA‐disease association, respectively. Compared with the existing functional similarity measurements of miRNAs, miRGOFS has the advantages of higher accuracy and larger coverage of human miRNAs (over 1000 miRNAs).

To address the aforementioned challenges, a Junction-Aware vehicle selection for Multipath Video Streaming (JA-MVS) scheme has been proposed. The JA-MVS scheme considers three different cases in the junction area including the vehicle after the junction, before the junction and inside the junction area, with an evaluation of the vehicle signal strength based on the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR), which is based on the multipath data forwarding concept using greedy-based geographic routing.

The first approach utilizes an additive regression framework with Gaussian process priors for the quantile regression functions and a scale uniform Dirichlet process mixture prior for the error distribution, which yields flexible unimodal error density shapes. Under the second approach, the joint distribution of the response and the covariates is modeled with a Dirichlet process mixture of multivariate normals, with posterior inference for different quantile curves emerging through the conditional distribution of the response given the covariates. The proposed nonparametric prior probability models allow the data to uncover non-linearities in the quantile regression function and non-standard distributional features in the response distribution.

In this paper, the design and electrical characterization of coplanar waveguides (CPWs) in flexible substrates such as Kapton polyimide and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) under uniaxial bending are studied and discussed. The fabricated lines were measured using a vector network analyzer (VNA) up to 8 GHz under both flat and bending conditions. Finite-element models (FEM) of CPW lines were created in ANSYS HFSS to capture the effect of bending on the CPW frequency response. In addition, the variations in the trace width and separations along the CPW lines were modeled accurately to capture the variations in the fabrication process and their effect on the CPW S-parameters in the flat condition. The finite element analysis of strain variation during bending was also performed and the relationship between strain variation and CPW performance was investigated. The bending of the CPW lines was carried out using two parallel plates that had a gap distance varying from 40 mm to 140 mm. The S-parameters were monitored in-situ while the substrate was under bending. The experimental results were compared against simulated results under both flat and bent configurations.

We evaluate different match refinement strategies based on 2D and 3D orientations and show the fundamental advantages of our approach.",3.0,0.3333333333333333,False,"['M', 'M', '-']","[None, None, None]","[None, None, None]","[None, None, None]",9,-1,0.0005965038829676,-1,1,0.058217987,0.475472629070282,0.5573121905326843,0.543255090713501,0.374979168176651,0.5105997920036316,0.0,9.0,5.0,134.0,85,93.0,0.6592592592592592,0.3777777777777777,2.081481481481481,3.539666666666676

Design/methodology/approach - This study uses secondary data obtained from World Development Indicators over the period 1985-2009, whose viability has also been checked through the World Bank and IFS. An Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) unit root test is used to estimate an autoregressive distributive lag (ARDL) approach to co-integration as the variables in the model are in I(1) and I(0) form and the Schwarz Bayesian Criterion (SBC) is used in this study to find out the estimated lags of the model, which are ultimately used to find out the short- and long-run relationship of the variables included in the model. The error correction model (ECM) was also applied which basically provides information about the causal factors that may affect the variables included in the model. Findings - The results provide evidence that there is an empirical relationship among FDI and economic growth. The computed value of Practical implications - The Government of China should keep keen emphasis on the ingredients of this study so that China could reap maximum share of FDI through the achievement of positive spillovers of foreign investment, which ultimately results in its economic growth. However, the ingredients of this study depict the expenditures on security status, growth options as well as on infrastructure. This study also gives better impending in decision making about FDI in case of China. Originality/value - This study bridges the gap between theory and practice and proves empirically the relationship between FDI and economic growth through auto regressive distributive lag approach (ARDL) to co-integration in case of China. This research includes most dominating factors in the model which differentiate it from all previous empirical researches related to FDI's relationship with economic growth.

We propose Rubik, a constrained non-negative tensor factorization and completion method for phenotyping. Rubik incorporates 1) guidance constraints to align with existing medical knowledge, and 2) pairwise constraints for obtaining distinct, non-overlapping phenotypes. Rubik also has built-in tensor completion that can significantly alleviate the impact of noisy and missing data. We utilize the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) framework to tensor factorization and completion, which can be easily scaled through parallel computing. We evaluate Rubik on two EHR datasets, one of which contains 647,118 records for 7,744 patients from an outpatient clinic, the other of which is a public dataset containing 1,018,614 CMS claims records for 472,645 patients. Our results show that Rubik can discover more meaningful and distinct phenotypes than the baselines. In particular, by using knowledge guidance constraints, Rubik can also discover sub-phenotypes for several major diseases. Rubik also runs around seven times faster than current state-of-the-art tensor methods.

The LACNN simulates the ophthalmologists’ diagnosis that focuses on local lesion-related regions when analyzing the OCT image.

The overall effectiveness of the sensor network depends on how well the mutually contradicting objectives of conserving the limited on-board battery power and keeping the sensors awake for stimuli, are managed. In this paper, we have proposed an actor-critic based reinforcement learning mechanism that can be practically implemented on an embedded sensor with limited memory and processing power.

The effectiveness of the proposed method has been demonstrated with real world experiments.",4.0,0.25,False,"['-', '-', '-', '-']","[None, None, None, 'The University of Texas, San Antonio']","[None, None, None, 2361]","[None, None, None, 270]",14,-1,6.132763018194634e-05,-1,-1,0.019740421,0.7110453844070435,0.5868099331855774,0.4299376010894775,0.4730400145053863,0.6072251200675964,1.0,19.0,6.0,161.0,109,92.08333333333331,0.6036585365853658,0.2926829268292683,1.9939024390243905,10.94885365853662

Comput.,"This thesis consists in six articles and a comprehensive summary. • The pourpose of the summary is to introduce the AGM theory of belief change and to exemplify the diversity and significance of the research that has been inspired by the AGM article in the last 25 years. The research areas associated with AGM was divided in three parts: criticisms, where we discussed some of the more common criticisms of AGM. Extensions where the most common extensions and variations of AGM are presented and applications where we provided an overview of applications and connections with other areas of research. • Article I elaborates on the connection between partial meet contractions [AGM85] and kernel contractions [Han94a] in belief change theory. Also both functions are equivalent in belief sets, there are notequivalent in belief bases. A way to define incision functions (used in kernel contractions) from selection functions (used in partial meet contractions) and vice versa is presented. It is explained under which conditions there are exact correspondences between selection and incision functions so that the same contraction operations can be obtained by using either of them. • Article II proposes an axiomatic characterization for ensconcement-based contraction functions, belief base functions proposed byWilliams and relates this function with other kinds of base contraction functions. • Article III adapts the Ferme and Hansson model of Shielded Contraction [FH01] as well as Hansson et all Credibility-Limited Revision [HFCF01] for belief bases, to join two of the many variations of the AGM model [AGM85], i.e. those in which knowledge is represented through belief bases instead of logic theories, and those in which the object of the epistemic change does not get the priority over the existing information as it is the case in the AGM model. • Article IV introduces revision by comparison a refined method for changing beliefs by specifying constraints on the relative plausibility of propositions. Like the earlier belief revision models, the method proposed is a qualitative one, in the sense that no numbers are needed in order to specify the posterior plausibility of the new information. The method uses reference beliefs in order to determine the degree of entrenchment of the newly accepted piece of information. Two kinds of semantics for this idea are proposed and a logical characterization of the new model is given. • Article V focuses on the extension of AGM that allows change for a belief base by a set of sentences instead of a single sentence. In [FH94], Fuhrmann and Hansson presented an axiomatic for Multiple Contraction and a construction based on the AGM Partial Meet Contraction. This essay proposes for their model another way to construct functions: Multiple Kernel Contraction, that is a modification of Kernel Contraction,proposed by Hansson [Han94a] to construct classical AGM contractions and belief base contractions. • Article VI relates AGM model with the DFT model proposed by Carlos Alchourron [Alc93]. Alchourron devoted his last years to the analysis of the notion of defeasible conditionalization. His definition of the defeasible conditional is given in terms of strict implication operator and a modal operator f which is interpreted as a revision function at the language level. This essay points out that this underlying revision function is more general than AGM revision. In addition, a complete characterization of that more general kind of revision that permits to unify models of revision given by other authors is given.",12.0,0.6,False,"['M', 'M', 'M']","['Full Professor - University of Madeira - NOVA-LINCS', None, None]","[66, None, None]","[17, None, None]",5,-1,5.874842286516317e-05,-1,1,0.09627017,0.439593642950058,0.7099753618240356,0.3483747243881225,0.5040619969367981,0.4287651777267456,1.0,58.0,23.0,563.0,240,87.10185185185185,0.5714285714285714,0.2589285714285714,1.9017857142857144,7.881428571428586

Model.,"A common task in the hit-to-lead process is classifying sets of compounds into multiple, usually structural classes, which build the groundwork for subsequent SAR studies. Machine learning techniques can be used to automate this process by learning classification models from training compounds of each class. Gathering class information for compounds can be cost-intensive as the required data needs to be provided by human experts or experiments. This paper studies whether active machine learning can be used to reduce the required number of training compounds. Active learning is a machine learning method which processes class label data in an iterative fashion. It has gained much attention in a broad range of application areas. In this paper, an active learning method for multiclass compound classification is proposed. This method selects informative training compounds so as to optimally support the learning progress. The combination with human feedback leads to a semiautomated interactive multiclass classification procedure. This method was investigated empirically on 15 compound classification tasks containing 86-2870 compounds in 3-38 classes. The empirical results show that active learning can solve these classification tasks using 10-80% of the data which would be necessary for standard learning techniques.",39.0,5.571428571428571,False,"['M', 'M', '-', 'M']","[None, None, 'University of Tübingen', None]","[None, None, 7158, None]","[None, None, 63, None]",9,-1,9.799768005499344e-05,-1,1,0.0801606,0.6832391023635864,0.508350670337677,0.3800271153450012,0.412906140089035,0.4035913944244385,1.0,21.0,11.0,193.0,113,94.97206703910616,0.6482412060301508,0.236180904522613,1.9396984924623115,24.974007537688465

In this paper, a recognition method based on the multi-level wavelet decomposition is proposed to accurately identify the running and digging intrusion signals in OFPS under the low SNR condition. The method includes the cross-correlation operation, feature extraction, and recognition using a random vector functional-link (RVFL) neural network (NN). Firstly, the collected signals are processed by the cross-correlation operation. Compared with the conventional filtering method, the background noise can be suppressed to the greatest extent by the cross-correlation operation, which keeps the signal details as much as possible. Secondly, the cross-correlation functions obtained from the cross-correlation operation are decomposed into five levels by the multi-level wavelet decomposition. And then the average energy ratios can be obtained along with the decomposed levels, and we select these ratios in the five frequency bands as the feature of intrusion signals. Next, the feature samples are sent into the RVFL NN for training so as to complete the recognition of these intrusion signals. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by the field experiment.",22.0,3.6666666666666665,False,"['F', '-', 'M', '-']","[None, None, 'North China University of Technology', None]","[None, None, None, None]","[None, None, 6, None]",14,-1,7.086326620752597e-05,-1,-1,0.056869593,0.6316012740135193,0.6787852048873901,0.6640112400054932,0.8277154564857483,0.5349142551422119,1.0,39.0,10.0,197.0,110,88.27127659574468,0.6057692307692307,0.2692307692307692,1.9567307692307687,19.06707692307694

Leakage of 14 C compounds from dried labelled sclerotia placed in water was rapid and was little affected by variation in leakage temperature from 1 to 25°C or by prolonging the drying period beyond a day. Leakage from dried sclerotia which were allowed to imbibe water through a small part of their surface was much reduced. Sclerotia which were redried after leakage leaked again when returned to water but with all four fungi the first of three leakage cycles gave the highest 14 C levels. Loss in dry weight in the first leakage cycle was greater with S. delphinii than with the other three fungi and this may be related to the poor survival of dried sclerotia of S. delphinii in moist soil.

In this paper, we present a real‐time rendering technique for such indirect views that involves the participating media. To achieve real‐time performance for computing indirect views, we leverage layered polygonal area lights (LPALs) that can be obtained by slicing the media into multiple flat layers. Using this representation, radiance entering each surface point from each slice of the volume is analytically evaluated to achieve instant calculation. The analytic solution can be derived for standard bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs) based on the microfacet theory. Accordingly, our method is sufficiently robust to work on surfaces with arbitrary shapes and roughness values. In addition, we propose a quadrature method for more accurate rendering of scenes with dense volumes, and a transformation of the domain of volumes to simplify the calculation and implementation of the proposed method.

New estimates of the mean long-term carbon forest sink (net biome production, NBP) of EU-25 forests amounts 75 +/- 20 g C m-2 yr-1. The ratio of NBP to NPP is 0.15 +/- 0.05. Estimates of the fate of the carbon inputs via NPP in wood harvests, forest fires, losses to lakes and rivers and heterotrophic respiration remain uncertain, which explains the considerable uncertainty of NBP. Inventory-based assessments and assumptions suggest that 29 +/- 15% of the NBP (i.e., 22 g C m-2 yr-1) is sequestered in the forest soil, but large uncertainty remains concerning the drivers and future of the soil organic carbon. The remaining 71 +/- 15% of the NBP (i.e., 53 g C m-2 yr-1) is realized as woody biomass increments.

The (CO)-O-18 traces the north-south molecular ridge, but the dense clumps identified by previous high-resolution HCO+ and dust continuum data do not stand out. Using H-2 column densities estimated from dust continuum measurements, we find that the CO abundance may be reduced by factors of at least 10 towards three positions (two of which are Class O protostars). Depending on the assumptions employed, the reduction may be as high as similar to 50 towards the clump positions. The magnitude of the reduced abundances is in good agreement with chemical models of collapsing clouds in which molecules accrete on to dust grains. Alternative interpretations, retaining normal abundances. and relying on subtle optical depth and beam filling effects, are considered, but shown to be less likely. The contrast in C I line intensity is low across the source. The greater part of the emission probably arises from the outer surface of the cloud, but it is impossible to determine the exact contribution from C atoms deeper into the core as their emission cannot be separated from that arising at the surface. Non-LTE radiative transfer modelling of the (CO)-O-18 emission towards the two Class O sources HH24MMS and HH25MMS confirms a widespread reduction of the CO abundance by a factor of greater than 10 within a radius of 0.3 pc and not just close to the clumps. In HH24MMS, the abundance is required to rise again towards the centre of the model clouds in accordance with the rise in temperature near to the central embedded object where CO is desorbed from grains. Application of the same radiative transfer model to the C I emission provides little constraint on the carbon abundance profile, although fits can be obtained for reasonable forms. The depletion of CO in the core, coupled with the lack of an infrared cluster, suggests that HH24-26 may be in the process of forming its first generation of stars.",27.0,1.08,False,"['-', '-']","['University of British Columbia', None]","[38, None]","[12, None]",18,1,6.132763018194634e-05,-1,1,0.08883232,0.4751786291599274,0.5888069868087769,0.4711416065692901,0.4015502333641052,0.4908754229545593,1.0,41.0,13.0,340.0,189,89.57100591715977,0.5893854748603352,0.2011173184357542,1.6675977653631284,37.03172905027935

In CV systems, it is not clear what the role of the ISP is, or if it is even required at all for accurate prediction. In this work, we investigate the efficacy of the ISP in CNN classification tasks, and outline the system-level trade-offs between prediction accuracy and computational cost. To do so, we build software models of a configurable ISP and an imaging sensor in order to train CNNs on ImageNet with a range of different ISP settings and functionality. Results on ImageNet show that an ISP improves accuracy by 4.6%-12.2% on MobileNet architectures of different widths. Results using ResNets demonstrate that these trends also generalize to deeper networks. An ablation study of the various processing stages in a typical ISP reveals that the tone mapper is the most significant stage when operating on high dynamic range (HDR) images, by providing 5.8% average accuracy improvement alone. Overall, the ISP benefits system efficiency because the memory and computational costs of the ISP is minimal compared to the cost of using a larger CNN to achieve the same accuracy.",4.0,1.0,False,"['-', '-']","['Tricog Health', None, None, None, None, 'ARM', None]","[253, None, None, None, None, 2993, None]","[36, None, None, None, None, 56, None]",15,1,0.0001881420755049,-1,1,0.09660752,0.5737853050231934,0.6281219124794006,0.679315447807312,0.3990621566772461,0.56821608543396,0.0,29.0,9.0,218.0,137,92.74509803921568,0.5982142857142857,0.2723214285714285,1.8928571428571428,22.136285714285748

A key contribution is the extension of the B-spline finite-element method to be compatible with the forward-difference gradient representation commonly used with images.

We called SNPs in the pooled data and estimated false positive and false negative rates using the SNPs called in individual strain as a reference. We also estimated allele frequency of the SNPs using “pooled” data and compared them with “true” frequencies taken from the estimates in the individual strains. We demonstrate that pooled sequencing provides a faithful estimate of population allele frequency with the error well approximated by binomial sampling, and is a reliable means of novel SNP discovery with low false positive rates. However, a sufficient number of strains should be used in the pooling because variation in the amount of DNA derived from individual strains is a substantial source of noise when the number of pooled strains is low.

To address these challenges, we propose a new method that firstly generates generic action region proposals with good potential to locate one human action in unconstrained videos regardless of camera motion and then uses action proposals to extract and classify effective shape and motion features by a ConvNet framework.

We consider a specific painting adduced as the primary evidence for this bold theory by Hockney and his collaborator, thin-film physicist Charles Falco: Lorenzo Lotto’s Husband and wife (c. 1543). These projection theorists attribute perspective anomalies in the painting to Lotto repositioning a concave mirror, specifically to overcome its limitations in depth of field. Their analysis lies thoroughly and crucially upon the assumption that the physical carpet pattern was symmetric. We point to a study of “Lotto carpets” surviving in museum collections that shows that these comparison carpets are significantly asymmetric. There seems to be no persuasive independent evidence to support the projection proponents’ assumption that these carpets, hand-knotted by children in 16th-century Turkey, were symmetric. Moreover, the angular asymmetries in these surviving carpets are nearly the same as those corresponding to the anomalies in the painting, strongly suggesting that these “anomalies” are in fact due to inherent carpet asymmetries, not to changes in configuration of an optical projector. We show that a non-optical explanation can fit the visual evidence with a precision roughly equal to that of the projection theory, but without the need to invoke a complicated, undocumented optical system. Finally, had Lotto used such an optical projector, we would expect both the general historical documentary record and Lotto’s own writings to indicate as much; however no such corroboratory evidence exists. We conclude by rejecting the numerous claims of “proof” that Lotto used optical projections when executing this painting.",7.0,0.3888888888888889,False,['-'],['Unknown affiliation'],[3697],[233],13,-1,6.0141517776995296e-05,-1,1,0.18173015,0.5102211833000183,0.5168561935424805,0.4848440587520599,0.3606191575527191,0.4148561656475067,0.0,32.0,10.0,280.0,177,94.26691729323308,0.5874125874125874,0.2937062937062937,1.9965034965034965,9.51080419580424
